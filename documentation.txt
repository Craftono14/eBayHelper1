GetMyeBayBuying
Use this call to retrieve information from the All Buying section of the authenticated user's My eBay account. You can review items that the user is watching, bidding on, has won, has not won, and those items on which they have made best offers or second chance offers. You can return a user's saved searches, their favorite sellers, and items that they have deleted from their lost and won lists. You can also return the lists that were created by the user (known as user defined lists).

GetMyeBayBuying returns information for only the user authenticated with the call. Responses are based on the information in their My eBay account.

Usage Details
Depending on the buying information you want to inspect, GetMyeBayBuying can return any combination of buying information contained in the user's My eBay account. For each response container you want returned, specify a value of true in the respective container's Include field in your request. For example, the following code returns the list of items that the user is currently watching:

  <WatchList>
    <Include>true</Include>
  </WatchList>
Each response container returns with a default set of fields. If you need, use the controls provided in each container to filter or alter the presentation of the default response set. For example, some containers can be sorted and some support pagination.

To return all the buying containers, set DetailLevel to ReturnAll. In this case, you only have to specify a container if you want to override the default return set with a custom setting. If you want to exclude a specific container from the response, set Include to false in the appropriate container.

Note, however, that BuyingSummary is not automatically returned when DetailLevel is set to ReturnAll; if you want a buying summary returned, you must specify the container in the request.

GetMyeBayBuying does not provide a way to specify maximum number of records returned that applies to all containers. However, you can specify the maximum number of records returned per container, provided that the container supports the MaxResults element.

In the UserDefinedLists container, you can specify whether all user defined lists are returned, or only the one specified. You can also specify whether list contents are returned, or only the names of the user defined lists.

Working with the Response
The BestOfferList, BidList, DeleteFromLostList, DeleteFromWonList, LostList, WatchList, and WonList containers all support pagination. It is recommended that you use pagination because results can be quite long.

The UserDefinedList container can return lists of sellers, searches, and/or items, depending on what the user has added.

Testing GetMyeBayBuying
You can test GetMyeBayBuying in the Sandbox. Because the call returns information for only the user making the call, you will need to use several test users to fully test the call. Create tokens for the different users and use the appropriate tokens when making calls for the different users. If needed, you can use automated test users in the Sandbox; see Testing in the SandBox for more information.

Create several sample listings with one registered Sandbox user. Use different (buying) Sandbox users to place bids and watches on the listings. With the buying test users, create and save searches and favorite seller lists.

When testing this call, make sure that the items returned in WatchList or BidList are active listings. Also, make sure that items returned in WonList or LostList are for listings that have ended. Check the user's My eBay accounts in the Sandbox user interface and make sure the lists returned by the call match those in the UI.

Request a WatchList, BidList, WonList, or LostList and specify a DurationInDays (valid values are 0-60). Check the user's My eBay account in the user interface and make sure the correct items are returned for the duration you specify.

Argument	Type	Occurrence	Meaning
Call-specific Input Fields [Jump to standard fields]
BestOfferList	ItemListCustomizationType	Optional	Include this container and set the BestOfferList.Include field to true to return the list of items on which the eBay user has made a Best Offer.

The user also has the option of using pagination and sorting for the list of items that will be returned.
BestOfferList.DurationInDays	int	Optional	Specifies the time period during which an item was won or lost. Similar to the period drop-down menu in the My eBay user interface. For example, to return the items won or lost in the last week, specify a DurationInDays of 7.
Min: 0. Max: 60.
BestOfferList.Include	boolean	Optional	Specifies whether or not to include the container in the response. Set the value to true to return the default set of fields for the container. Not needed if you set a value for at least one other field in the container.

If you set DetailLevel to ReturnAll, set Include to false to exclude the container from the response.
BestOfferList.IncludeNotes	boolean	Optional	Specifies whether or not to include Item.PrivateNotes and Item.eBayNotes in the response.
Default: false.
BestOfferList.ListingType	ListingTypeCodeType	Optional	Specifies the listing type of items in the returned list.

Applicable values:

AdType
(in/out) This enumeration value represents a classified ad in a Real Estate category. This listing type is only used to solicit inquiries from interested parties. To express interest, a buyer fills in a contact form that eBay forwards to the seller as a lead. This format does not enable buyers and sellers to transact online through eBay, and eBay Feedback is not available for ad format listings.

Although listing durations may vary by eBay marketplace and category, typical listing durations for real estate ads are 30 and 90 days. It is recommended that the seller uses the GetCategoryFeatures call to retrieve the actual listing durations that are supported for real estate ads on a particular marketplace and category.
Auction
(in/out) This enumeration value is only applicable to the GetMyeBaySelling call. This value is used in the ActiveList.ListingType field if the seller only wants to retrieve active listings that are in the auction format.
FixedPriceItem
(in/out) With this listing format, the selling is offering the item at a fixed price, although it is still possible for the seller to negotiate the price with prospective buyers using the Best Offer feature. A fixed-price listing can offer a single item, or if the seller has multiple quantity of the same item, multiple quantity of that same item can be made available for sale through the same listing. Additionally, the seller can set up a multiple-variation, fixed-price listing, where similar items can be sold through the same listing. An example of a multiple-variation, fixed-price listing might be a t-shirt (or another article of clothing) that is available in multiple color and size combinations.

Traditionally, listing durations for fixed-prices listings have varied by eBay marketplace and category. Typical listing durations for fixed-price listings ranged from three to 30 days, or GTC (Good 'Til Cancelled). As of April 1, 2019, 'GTC' is the only supported listing duration for all eBay marketplaces with the following exceptions:
The following eBay Motors US categories are exempt from this change: Cars & Trucks (6001), Motorcycles (6024), Other Vehicles & Trailers (6038), Boats (26429), Powersports (66466).
All child categories under Cars, Motorcycles & Vehicles (9800) categories on the eBay UK and eBay Italy sites are also exempt from this change.

With the 'GTC' listing duration, the listing will remain active as long as the listing shows that inventory is available for purchase (available quantity is '1' or more). For sellers listing motor vehicles on the eBay US Motors, eBay UK, or eBay Italy sites, it is recommended that the seller uses the GetCategoryFeatures call to retrieve the supported listing durations for their particular marketplace and category.

Note: As long as a fixed-price listing has inventory available, or if the out-of-stock control feature is being used, GTC listings are automatically renewed each month according to the calendar day.

Standard Input Fields  
DetailLevel	DetailLevelCodeType	Optional,
repeatable: [0..*]	Detail levels are instructions that define standard subsets of data to return for particular data components (e.g., each Item, Transaction, or User) within the response payload. For example, a particular detail level might cause the response to include buyer-related data in every result (e.g., for every Item), but no seller-related data.

Specifying a detail level is like using a predefined attribute list in the SELECT clause of an SQL query. Use the DetailLevel element to specify the required detail level that the client application needs pertaining to the data components that are applicable to the request.

The DetailLevelCodeType defines the global list of available detail levels for all request types. Most request types support certain detail levels or none at all. If you pass a detail level that exists in the schema but that isn't valid for a particular request, eBay ignores it and processes the request without it.

For each request type, see the detail level tables in the Input/Output Reference to determine which detail levels are applicable and which elements are returned for each applicable detail level.

Note that DetailLevel is required input for GetMyMessages.

With GetSellerList and other calls that retrieve large data sets, please avoid using ReturnAll when possible. For example, if you use GetSellerList, use GranularityLevel instead, or use GetSellerEvents. If you do use 'ReturnAll' with GetSellerList, use a small Pagination.EntriesPerPage value and a narrow EndTimeFrom/EndTimeTo date range for better performance.

Applicable values:

ReturnAll
(in) Returns all available data. With GetSellerList and other calls that retrieve large data sets, please avoid using ReturnAll when possible. For example, if you use GetSellerList, use a GranularityLevel or use the GetSellerEvents call instead. If you use ReturnAll with GetSellerList, use a small EntriesPerPage value and a short EndTimeFrom/EndTimeTo range for better performance.
ReturnSummary
(in) Returns the summary data. For GetMyMessages, this detail level returns the same data whether or not you include MessageIDs in the request. Returns up to 10 FolderID and FolderName values. Currently, this detail level is the only way to retrieve FolderID and FolderName values. See GetMyMessages for a code sample that demonstrates this.

(Not all values in DetailLevelCodeType apply to this field.)
ErrorLanguage	string	Optional	Use ErrorLanguage to return error strings for the call in a different language from the language commonly associated with the site that the requesting user is registered with. Below are some examples from different countries.

ID	Country
en_AU	Australia
de_AT	Austria
nl_BE	Belgium (Dutch)
fr_BE	Belgium (French)
en_CA	Canada
fr_CA	Canada (French)
zh_CN	China
fr_FR	France
de_DE	Germany
zh_HK	Hong Kong
en_IN	India
en_IE	Ireland
it_IT	Italy
nl_NL	Netherlands
en_SG	Singapore
es_ES	Spain
de_CH	Switzerland
en_GB	United Kingdom
en_US	United States
MessageID	string	Optional	Most Trading API calls support a MessageID element in the request and a CorrelationID element in the response. If you pass in a MessageID in a request, the same value will be returned in the CorrelationID field in the response. Pairing these values can help you track and confirm that a response is returned for every request and to match specific responses to specific requests. If you do not pass a MessageID value in the request, CorrelationID is not returned.

Note: GetCategories is designed to retrieve very large sets of metadata that change once a day or less often. To improve performance, these calls return cached responses when you request all available data (with no filters). When this occurs, the MessageID and CorrelationID fields aren't applicable. However, if you specify an input filter to reduce the amount of data returned, the calls retrieve the latest data (not cached). When this occurs, MessageID and CorrelationID are applicable.
OutputSelector	string	Optional,
repeatable: [0..*]	You can use the OutputSelector field to restrict the data returned by a call. This field can make the call response easier to manage, especially when a large payload is returned. If you use the OutputSelector field, the output data will only include the field(s) you specified in the request, as well as all of its child fields (if a field is a container) and its parent fields (if any). Note that it is possible that a field included through an OutputSelector field may still not be returned if it is not applicable, or if it is not found based on other criteria set up in the request payload.

For example, if you are using GetItem and you only want to retrieve the URL of the View Item page (emitted in ViewItemURL field) and the item's Buy It Now price (emitted in BuyItNowPrice field), you would include two separate OutputSelector fields and set the value for each one as ViewItemURL and BuyItNowPrice as in the following example:

 If the following output selectors are used: 

...
 <OutputSelector>ViewItemURL</OutputSelector>
 <OutputSelector>BuyItNowPrice</OutputSelector> 
... 

 ...the response might look like the following 

  <Item>
 <BuyItNowPrice currencyID="USD">0.0</BuyItNowPrice>
 <ListingDetails>
 <ViewItemURL>http://www.ebay.com/itm/Tag-Heuer-Mens-Watch/182879833261</ViewItemURL>
 </ListingDetails>
 </Item>  
See OutputSelector.

Version	string	Conditional	The version number of the API code that you are programming against (e.g., 1149). The version you specify for a call has these basic effects:
It indicates the version of the code lists and other data that eBay should use to process your request.
It indicates the schema version you are using.
You need to use a version that is greater than or equal to the lowest supported version.
For the SOAP API: If you are using the SOAP API, this field is required. Specify the version of the WSDL your application is using.

For the XML API: If you are using the XML API, this field has no effect. Instead, specify the version in the X-EBAY-API-COMPATIBILITY-LEVEL HTTP header. (If you specify Version in the body of an XML API request and it is different from the value in the HTTP header, eBay returns an informational warning that the value in the HTTP header was used instead.)
See:
    HTTP headers
    eBay Schema Versioning Strategy
    Lowest Supported Version

WarningLevel	WarningLevelCodeType	Optional	Controls whether or not to return warnings when the application passes unrecognized or deprecated elements in a request.

An unrecognized element is one that is not defined in any supported version of the schema. Schema element names are case-sensitive, so using WarningLevel can also help you remove any potential hidden bugs within your application due to incorrect case or spelling in field names before you put your application into the Production environment.

WarningLevel only validates elements; it doesn't validate XML attributes. It also doesn't control warnings related to user-entered strings or numbers, or warnings for logical errors.

We recommend that you only use this during development and debugging. Do not use this in requests performed in the Production environment.

Applicable values:

High
(in) The WarningLevel value is set to High if the user wishes to receive warnings when the application passes unrecognized or deprecated elements in an API call request. Setting the WarningLevel value to High is not recommended in a production environment. Instead, it should only be used during the development/debugging stage.
Low
(in) The WarningLevel value is set to Low if the user does not wish to receive warnings when the application passes unrecognized or deprecated elements in an API call request. This is the default value if WarningLevel is not specified in the call request.
See Warning Level.

Return Value	Type	Occurrence	Meaning
Call-specific Output Fields [Jump to standard fields]
BestOfferList	PaginatedItemArrayType	Conditionally	This container consists of the items on which the eBay user has made Best Offers. This container will be returned if the eBay user has made one or more Best Offers.

This container will not be returned in the response (even if user has made Best Offers) if the DetailLevel value is set to ReturnSummary and the BestOfferList.Include field is omitted or set to false.

DetailLevel: ReturnAll.
BestOfferList.ItemArray	ItemArrayType	Conditionally	An array of one or more items returned under one or more containers in a GetMyeBayBuying or GetMyeBaySelling call response.

DetailLevel: ReturnAll. Also returned if DetailLevel is not provided on input.
BestOfferList.ItemArray.Item	ItemType	Conditionally,
repeatable: [0..*]	Contains the data properties that define one item listing. GetSellerEvents and GetSellerList only return items if any are available for the seller within the time window specified in the request.

Some optional fields are only returned if the seller defined them for the item. Some fields are only returned under particular conditions specified in the individual field descriptions. For example, a buyer's contact information might only be returned if the member who is making the request (as identified in the eBayAuthToken) has an order relationship with that buyer.

For calls that support detail levels, the set of fields returned is also controlled by the value of DetailLevel in the request. For some calls, other parameters in the request can also control the data returned for each item. For example, GranularityLevel controls the fields to return for each item in the GetSellerList response.
Note: When making a GetSellerList call, items that are on-hold due to an eBay policy violation will not be returned in the response.


DetailLevel: ReturnAll. Also returned if DetailLevel is not provided on input.
BestOfferList.ItemArray.Item
  .BestOfferDetails	BestOfferDetailsType	Conditionally	For Add/Revise/Relist/Verify calls: This container is used to enable the Best Offer feature on a listing. Note that the Best Offer feature can be set for auction listings on the US, Canada, UK, Germany, Australia, France, Italy, and Spain marketplaces, but a seller can only use Best Offer or Buy It Now, but not both. Once an auction listing receives a qualifying bid, the Best Offer feature will be turned off and any pending Best Offers or Counteroffers will no longer be valid.

For GetItem and other calls that retrieve item data, this container will include the status (GetMyeBayBuying only) and dollar amount of the latest Best Offer on a fixed-price listing, and the number of Best Offers received for the fixed-price listing.

Note: Best Offer is not available for multi-variation listings.


DetailLevel: ReturnAll. Also returned if DetailLevel is not provided on input.
BestOfferList.ItemArray.Item
  .BestOfferDetails.BestOffer	AmountType (double)	Conditionally	This is the amount of the buyer's current Best Offer. This field will not appear in the GetMyeBayBuying response if the buyer has not made a Best Offer. This field is also not applicable to the Add/Revise/Relist calls.

DetailLevel: ReturnAll. Also returned if DetailLevel is not provided on input.
BestOfferList.ItemArray.Item
  .BestOfferDetails.BestOffer
  [ attribute currencyID ]	CurrencyCodeType	Conditionally	This is the amount of the buyer's current Best Offer. This field will not appear in the GetMyeBayBuying response if the buyer has not made a Best Offer. This field is also not applicable to the Add/Revise/Relist calls.

For a list of possible enumeration values, see CurrencyCodeType.
BestOfferList.ItemArray.Item
  .BestOfferDetails
  .BestOfferStatus	BestOfferStatusCodeType	Conditionally	This enumeration value indicates the status of the latest Best Offer from the buyer. This field is only applicable to the GetMyeBayBuying call, and will not appear in the response if the buyer has not made a Best Offer.

Applicable values: See BestOfferStatus.

DetailLevel: ReturnAll. Also returned if DetailLevel is not provided on input.
BestOfferList.ItemArray.Item
  .BuyItNowPrice	AmountType (double)	Conditionally	This field is only applicable for auction listings. By specifying a 'Buy It Now' price, a seller is allowing prospective buyers the opportunity to purchase the item in the auction listing at this price immediately. When a buyer uses the 'Buy It Now' option to purchase the item, the auction listing will end immediately.

By including this field and specifying a 'Buy It Now' price, the seller is enabling the 'Buy It Now' feature on the auction listing. If the seller includes this field for any other listing type other than an auction, this field and its price will just be ignored.

The price in this field must be at least 30 percent higher than the starting bid price (which is specified in an Add call through the Item.StartPrice field). Once a bid is made on an auction listing, and the bid meets or exceeds the Item.ReservePrice value (if set), the 'Buy It Now' option becomes unavailable, and this field will no longer be applicable. If there is no Reserve Price, the first bid will nullify the 'Buy It Now' option.

Keep in mind that GetItem (and other 'Get' calls that retrieve the Item details) may still return the BuyItNowPrice field for an auction item even if the 'Buy It Now' option is no longer available. Instead, a user should look for the ListingDetails.BuyItNowAvailable boolean field in the GetItem response to determine if the 'Buy It Now' option is still available for the auction item.

Note: For the US site, new eBay sellers are subject to Seller Limits, which limit the quantity of items that may be listed and/or the total cumulative value of these listings. While subject to these selling limits, an eBay seller can use the GetMyeBaySelling call to retrieve both the remaining number of listings they can create and the remaining cumulative value of these listings. These values are shown in the Summary.QuantityLimitRemaining and Summary.AmountLimitRemaining fields in the GetMyeBaySelling response. If a call to add an item or revise an item would result in the exceeding of these limits, the add item or revise item call will fail. These fields will only be returned if the seller is subject to seller limits.


DetailLevel: ReturnAll. Also returned if DetailLevel is not provided on input.
BestOfferList.ItemArray.Item
  .BuyItNowPrice
  [ attribute currencyID ]	CurrencyCodeType	Conditionally	This field is only applicable for auction listings. By specifying a 'Buy It Now' price, a seller is allowing prospective buyers the opportunity to purchase the item in the auction listing at this price immediately. When a buyer uses the 'Buy It Now' option to purchase the item, the auction listing will end immediately.

By including this field and specifying a 'Buy It Now' price, the seller is enabling the 'Buy It Now' feature on the auction listing. If the seller includes this field for any other listing type other than an auction, this field and its price will just be ignored.

The price in this field must be at least 30 percent higher than the starting bid price (which is specified in an Add call through the Item.StartPrice field). Once a bid is made on an auction listing, and the bid meets or exceeds the Item.ReservePrice value (if set), the 'Buy It Now' option becomes unavailable, and this field will no longer be applicable. If there is no Reserve Price, the first bid will nullify the 'Buy It Now' option.

Keep in mind that GetItem (and other 'Get' calls that retrieve the Item details) may still return the BuyItNowPrice field for an auction item even if the 'Buy It Now' option is no longer available. Instead, a user should look for the ListingDetails.BuyItNowAvailable boolean field in the GetItem response to determine if the 'Buy It Now' option is still available for the auction item.

Note: For the US site, new eBay sellers are subject to Seller Limits, which limit the quantity of items that may be listed and/or the total cumulative value of these listings. While subject to these selling limits, an eBay seller can use the GetMyeBaySelling call to retrieve both the remaining number of listings they can create and the remaining cumulative value of these listings. These values are shown in the Summary.QuantityLimitRemaining and Summary.AmountLimitRemaining fields in the GetMyeBaySelling response. If a call to add an item or revise an item would result in the exceeding of these limits, the add item or revise item call will fail. These fields will only be returned if the seller is subject to seller limits.


For a list of possible enumeration values, see CurrencyCodeType.
BestOfferList.ItemArray.Item
  .eBayNotes	string	Conditionally	Returns a note from eBay displayed below items in the user's My eBay account.

DetailLevel: ReturnAll. Also returned if DetailLevel is not provided on input.
BestOfferList.ItemArray.Item
  .ItemID	ItemIDType (string)	Conditionally	The unique identifier of the eBay listing. This identifier is generated by eBay and returned in the response of an Add call if an item is successfully listed. Once an item is successfully created, the ItemID cannot be modified.

Note: Although we represent item IDs as strings in the schema, we recommend you store them as 64-bit signed integers. If you choose to store item IDs as strings, allocate at least 19 characters (assuming decimal digits are used) to hold them. Your code should be prepared to handle IDs of up to 19 digits.


DetailLevel: ReturnAll. Also returned if DetailLevel is not provided on input.
BestOfferList.ItemArray.Item
  .ListingDetails	ListingDetailsType	Conditionally	Various details about a listing, some of which are calculated or derived after the item is listed. These include the start and end time, converted (localized) prices, and certain flags that indicate whether the seller specified fields whose values are not visible to the requesting user. For GetMyeBayBuying, returned as a self-closed element if no listings meet the request criteria.

In an Add/Revise/Relist call, this container is used to set the Best Offer Auto-Accept and Best Offer Auto-Decline threshold values.

DetailLevel: ReturnAll. Also returned if DetailLevel is not provided on input.
BestOfferList.ItemArray.Item
  .ListingDetails
  .ConvertedBuyItNowPrice	AmountType (double)	Conditionally	
Converted value of the BuyItNowPrice in the currency of the site that returned this response. For active items, refresh this value every 24 hours to pick up the current conversion rates.
Note: The ListingDetails.ConvertedBuyItNowPrice field will stop being returned in GetItemTransactions, GetSellerTransactions, and GetMyeBaySelling (SoldList and DeletedFromSoldList) on January 31, 2024.

BestOfferList.ItemArray.Item
  .ListingDetails
  .ConvertedBuyItNowPrice
  [ attribute currencyID ]	CurrencyCodeType	Conditionally	
Converted value of the BuyItNowPrice in the currency of the site that returned this response. For active items, refresh this value every 24 hours to pick up the current conversion rates.
Note: The ListingDetails.ConvertedBuyItNowPrice field will stop being returned in GetItemTransactions, GetSellerTransactions, and GetMyeBaySelling (SoldList and DeletedFromSoldList) on January 31, 2024.


For a list of possible enumeration values, see CurrencyCodeType.
BestOfferList.ItemArray.Item
  .ListingDetails.StartTime	dateTime	Conditionally	The StartTime value returned by non-search calls such as GetItem is the time stamp (in GMT) for when the item was listed.

DetailLevel: ReturnAll. Also returned if DetailLevel is not provided on input.
BestOfferList.ItemArray.Item
  .PictureDetails	PictureDetailsType	Conditionally	This container consists of the data associated with photos within the listing. Sellers can have up to 24 pictures in almost any category at no cost. Motor vehicle listings are an exception. The number of included pictures in motor vehicle listings depend on the selected vehicle package (see Fees for selling vehicles on eBay Motors). These photos can be hosted by eBay Picture Services (EPS), or the seller can host pictures on a non-eBay server. If pictures are externally-hosted, they must be hosted on a site that is using the 'https' protocol.

It is required that all listings have at least one picture.

DetailLevel: ReturnAll. Also returned if DetailLevel is not provided on input.

BestOfferList.ItemArray.Item
  .PictureDetails.GalleryURL	anyURI	Conditionally	This field shows the URL for the gallery image of an item returned in GetMyeBayBuying
and GetMyeBaySelling.

Max length: 1024.

DetailLevel: ReturnAll. Also returned if DetailLevel is not provided on input.
BestOfferList.ItemArray.Item
  .PrivateNotes	string	Conditionally	A note that a user makes on an item from their My eBay account. GetMyeBayBuying and GetMyeBaySelling return this field, and only if you pass in the IncludeNotes field in the request, and set its value to true. This field will only be returned if set for an item, and only returned to the user who created the note.

Not supported as input in ReviseItem. Use SetUserNotes instead.

For GetMyeBayBuying In WatchList, notes for variations are only returned at the Item level, not the variation level. They are only set if you specified ItemID (if no purchases) or ItemID and VariationSpecifics (if there are purchases) in SetUserNotes (or selected the equivalent in the My eBay UI on the site).

In WonList, notes for variations are only returned at the Item level, not the variation level. They are only set if you specified ItemID and TransactionID in SetUserNotes (or selected the equivalent in the My eBay UI on the site).
BestOfferList.ItemArray.Item
  .Seller	UserType	Conditionally	Container for information about this listing's seller.

Applicable values: See FeedbackRatingStar.
Code so that your app gracefully handles any future changes to this list.

DetailLevel: ReturnAll. Also returned if DetailLevel is not provided on input.
BestOfferList.ItemArray.Item
  .Seller.FeedbackScore	int	Conditionally	The aggregate feedback score for a user. A user's feedback score is the net positive feedback minus the net negative feedback left for the user. Feedback scores are a quantitative expression of the desirability of dealing with a user as a buyer or a seller in either side of an order.

Each order line item can result in one feedback entry for a given user (the buyer can leave feedback for the seller, and the seller can leave feedback for the buyer.). That one feedback can be positive, negative, or neutral. The aggregated feedback counts for a particular user represent that user's overall feedback score (referred to as a "feedback rating" on the eBay site).

If the user has chosen to make their feedback private and that user is not the user identified in the request's authentication token, FeedbackScore is not returned and FeedbackPrivate is returned with a value of true.

In GetMyeBayBuying and GetMyeBaySelling, feedback information (FeedbackScore and FeedbackRatingStar) is returned in BidList.ItemArray.Item.Seller. For GetMyeBayBuying, the feedback score of each seller with an item having received a bid from the buyer is returned. For GetMyeBaySelling, the feedback score of the seller is returned.

GetMyeBayBuying and GetMyeBaySelling also return feedback information (FeedbackScore and FeedbackRatingStar) in BidList.ItemArray.Item.SellingStatus.HighBidder. GetMyeBayBuying returns feedback information on the high bidder of each item the buyer is bidding on. GetMyeBaySelling returns feedback information on the high bidder of each item the seller is selling.

Since a bidder's user info is anonymous, the real feedback score will be returned only to that bidder, and to the seller of an item that the user is bidding on. For all other users, the value -99 is returned.

For GetOrders and GetItemTransactions only: If using Trading WSDL Version 1019 or above, this field will only be returned to the buyer or seller, and no longer returned at all to third parties. If using a Trading WSDL older than Version 1019, the accurate Feedback Score for the user is returned to the buyer or seller, but a dummy value of 0 will be returned to all third parties.

DetailLevel: ReturnAll. Also returned if DetailLevel is not provided on input.
See Anonymous user information.

BestOfferList.ItemArray.Item
  .Seller.UserID	UserIDType (string)	Conditionally	Unique eBay user ID for the user.

Note: Effective September 26, 2025, select developers will no longer receive username data for U.S. users through this field. Instead, an immutable user ID will be returned in its place. For more information, please refer to Data Handling Compliance.

Since a bidder's user info is anonymous, this tag contains the actual value of an ID only for that bidder, and for the seller of an item that the user is bidding on. For other users, the actual value is replaced by an anonymous value, according to these rules:

When bidding on items, UserID is replaced with the value "a****b" where a and b are random characters from the UserID. For example, if the UserID = IBidALot, it might be displayed as, "I****A".

Important: In this format, the anonymous bidder ID can change for each auction.
For GetMyeBayBuying only, when bidding on items: UserID is replaced with the value "a****b" where a and b are random characters from the UserID.

When bidding on items listed on the Philippines site: UserID is replaced with the value "Bidder X" where X is a number indicating the order of that user's first bid. For example, if the user was the third bidder, UserID = Bidder 3. Note that in this Philippines site format, the anonymous bidder ID stays the same for a given auction, but is different for different auctions. For example, a bidder who is the third and then the seventh bidder in an auction will be listed for both bids as "Bidder 3". However, if that same bidder is the first bidder on a different auction, the bidder will be listed for that auction as "Bidder 1", not "Bidder 3".

For GetMyeBayBuying only, when bidding on items listed on the UK and AU sites: UserID is replaced with the string "High Bidder".

For PlaceOffer, see also SellingStatus.HighBidder.

DetailLevel: ReturnAll. Also returned if DetailLevel is not provided on input.
See Anonymous user information.

BestOfferList.ItemArray.Item
  .SellingStatus	SellingStatusType	Conditionally	Various details about the current status of the listing, such as the current number of bids, the current high bidder, quantity sold, current price, and listing status.

  .SellingStatus
  .ConvertedCurrentPrice	AmountType (double)	Conditionally	Converted value of the CurrentPrice in the currency of the site that returned this response. For active items, refresh the listing's data every 24 hours to pick up the current conversion rates. Only returned when the item's CurrentPrice on the listing site is in different currency than the currency of the host site for the user/application making the API call. ConvertedCurrentPrice is not returned for Classified listings (Classified listings are not available on all sites).

In multi-variation listings, this value matches the lowest-priced variation that is still available for sale.

Only returned when the item's CurrentPrice on the listing site is in different currency than the currency of the host site for the user/application making the API call. ConvertedCurrentPrice is not returned for Classified listings (Classified listings are not available on all sites).

In multi-variation listings, this value matches the lowest-priced variation that is still available for sale.

For a list of possible enumeration values, see CurrencyCodeType.
BestOfferList.ItemArray.Item
  .SellingStatus.CurrentPrice	AmountType (double)	Conditionally	The current price of the item in the original listing currency.

For auction listings, this price is the starting minimum price (if the listing has no bids) or the current highest bid (if bids have been placed) for the item. This does not reflect the BuyItNow price.

For fixed-price and ad format listings, this is the current listing price.

In multi-variation, fixed-price listings, this value matches the lowest-priced variation that is still available for sale.

DetailLevel: ReturnAll. Also returned if DetailLevel is not provided on input.
BestOfferList.ItemArray.Item
  .SellingStatus.CurrentPrice
  [ attribute currencyID ]	CurrencyCodeType	Conditionally	The current price of the item in the original listing currency.

For auction listings, this price is the starting minimum price (if the listing has no bids) or the current highest bid (if bids have been placed) for the item. This does not reflect the BuyItNow price.

For fixed-price and ad format listings, this is the current listing price.

In multi-variation, fixed-price listings, this value matches the lowest-priced variation that is still available for sale.

For a list of possible enumeration values, see CurrencyCodeType.
BestOfferList.ItemArray.Item
  .ShippingDetails	ShippingDetailsType	Conditionally	The shipping-related details for an order, including flat and calculated shipping costs.

Note: For sellers who are using a shipping (aka Fulfillment) business policy to create/revise/relist an item, none of the fields under the ShippingDetails container are necessary. A fulfillment business policy can be set up and/or modified in My eBay, or via the Account API. A fulfillment business policy is associated to a listing through the Item.SellerProfiles.SellerShippingProfile container.

If you do not use a fulfillment business policy, many of the fields under this ShippingDetails container become required in your request.
Note: For ReviseItem and ReviseFixedPriceItem calls: If you are updating any field under the ShippingDetails container, you must include all containers and fields set under this container even if their values are not changing. If you do not do this, some fields may be removed from the listing. To find out the values included in the current listing, call GetItem and look through the ShippingDetails container in the response. For additional information, see Revise shipping details.
New users who list their first items in selected categories on the US site must specify at least one domestic shipping service. This applies to a category if GetCategoryFeatures returns true for Category.ShippingTermsRequired.

For multi-quantity, fixed-price listings, a seller can revise all shipping details of the listing (except for sales tax and for shipping type of Freight) for all unsold items. This applies to both domestic and international shipping. Checkout is not affected for those who bought items prior to the seller's shipping changes—the shipping details that were in effect at the time of purchase are used for that buyer at the time of checkout.

Shipping details are not applicable to any classified ad listings, as shipping/delivery/pickup is handled by the buyer and seller off of the eBay platform.

Note: To create a listing that is 'Local Pickup only' (buyer picks up, with no shipping/delivery available), the user does the following two things:
Either omit the entire ShippingDetails container, or pass in an empty ShippingDetails container - <ShippingDetails/>
Pass in one ShipToLocations field, with its value set to None - <ShipToLocations>None</ShipToLocations>

For GetMyeBayBuying, GetMyeBaySelling: ShippingDetails is not returned.

DetailLevel: ReturnAll. Also returned if DetailLevel is not provided on input.

BestOfferList.ItemArray.Item
  .ShippingDetails
  .InternationalShippingServiceOption	InternationalShippingServiceOptionsType	Conditionally,
repeatable: [0..*]	Shipping costs and options related to an international shipping service. If used, at least one domestic shipping service must also be provided in ShippingServiceOptions.

If you specify multiple InternationalShippingServiceOption nodes, the repeating nodes must be contiguous. That is, you cannot insert other nodes between InternationalShippingServiceOption nodes.

All specified domestic and international shipping services must be the same shipping type (for example, Flat versus Calculated).

A seller can offer up to four domestic shipping services and up to five international shipping services. However, if the seller is opted in to the Global Shipping Program or eBay International Shipping, only four other international shipping services may be offered (regardless of whether or not Global Shipping or eBay International Shipping is offered for the listing).

If you specify ShippingDetails when you revise or relist an item but you omit InternationalShippingServiceOption, eBay will drop the international shipping services (except the Global Shipping Program or eBay International Shipping) from the listing. This may also have unintended side effects, as other fields that depend on this data may be dropped as well. To retain the shipping services and dependent fields when you modify other shipping details, it may be simplest to specify all ShippingDetails that you still want to include in the listing.

For GetItemShipping, results are filtered: if any service is not available in the buyer's region, it is removed. If no services remain after this filtering, a warning is returned.

DetailLevel: ReturnAll. Also returned if DetailLevel is not provided on input.
See Repeating (unbounded) fields for rules regarding repeating instances of a nodes (nodes for which maxOccurs is "unbounded" or is greater than 1).

BestOfferList.ItemArray.Item
  .ShippingDetails
  .ShippingServiceOptions	ShippingServiceOptionsType	Conditionally,
repeatable: [0..*]	This container is used to provide details on a specific domestic shipping service option, including the unique identifier of the shipping service option and the costs related to domestic shipping service. A separate ShippingServiceOptions container is needed for each domestic shipping service option that is available to ship the item. Unless a fulfillment business policy is being used, generally at least one ShippingServiceOptions container will be required.

If you specify multiple ShippingServiceOptions nodes, the repeating nodes must be contiguous. For example, you can insert InternationalShippingServiceOption nodes after a list of repeating ShippingServiceOptions nodes, but not between them:

<ShippingServiceOptions>...</ShippingServiceOptions>
<ShippingServiceOptions>...</ShippingServiceOptions>
<ShippingServiceOptions>...</ShippingServiceOptions>
<InternationalShippingServiceOption>...</InternationalShippingServiceOption>
<InternationalShippingServiceOption>...</InternationalShippingServiceOption>

If you specify ShippingDetails when you revise or relist an item but you omit ShippingServiceOptions, eBay will drop the domestic shipping services from the listing. This may also have unintended side effects, as other fields that depend on this data may be dropped as well.

To retain the shipping services and dependent fields when you modify other shipping details, it may be simplest to specify all ShippingDetails that you still want to include in the listing.

A seller can offer up to four domestic shipping services and up to five international shipping services. However, if the seller is opted in to the Global Shipping Program or eBay International Shipping, only four other international shipping services may be offered (regardless of whether or not Global Shipping shipment or eBay International Shipping is offered for the listing). All specified domestic and international shipping services must be the same shipping type (for example, Flat versus Calculated).

Note: If the seller has set the shipping cost model to 'Flat' or 'Calculated' (ShippingDetails.ShippingType field), at least one actual shipping service option must be specified through a ShippingServiceOptions container. In the past, eBay allowed users to set the shipping cost model to 'Flat' or 'Calculated', and then just pass in one ShippingServiceOptions container with the ShippingServiceOptions.ShipppingService value set to a 'Local Pickup' option. Now, sellers must pass in at least one actual domestic shipping service option in addition to any 'Local Pickup' option, or the listing will be blocked with the following error: 17510 - You must specify at least one domestic shipping service, other than or in addition to Local Pickup.

For GetItemShipping, results are filtered: if any service is not available in the buyer's region, it is removed. If no services remain after this filtering, a warning is returned.

  .ShippingDetails
  .ShippingServiceOptions
  .ExpeditedService	boolean	Conditionally	This field is returned as true if the domestic shipping service is considered an expedited shipping service. An expedited service is typically a shipping service that can ship an order that will arrive at the buyer's location within one to two business days.
BestOfferList.ItemArray.Item
  .ShippingDetails
  .ShippingServiceOptions
  .FreeShipping	boolean	Conditionally	This boolean field indicates whether or not the corresponding domestic shipping service option is free to the buyer. In an Add/Revise/Relist call, free shipping can only be offered for the first specified shipping service (so, the corresponding ShippingServicePriority value should be 1 or included first in the call request). If 'free shipping' is for any other shipping service, this field is ignored.

For 'Get' calls, including GetItem, this field is only returned if 1.
Note: If a seller is specifying a shipping service option as 'free shipping', in addition to this FreeShipping boolean field, the seller will also need to include the corresponding ShippingServiceCost field and set its value to 0.0, as eBay will not do this automatically.
Note: If the condition is certified refurbished (ConditionID set to 2000, 'Certified - Refurbished'), you must offer a free shipping option. Set FreeShipping as true (or 1) along with the ShippingServiceCost as 0.0 for the first domestic shipping service.

The LocalPickup flag can also be used with other fields to indicate if there is no fee for local pickup.

For example, if the LocalPickup flag is used with the ShippingServiceOptions and ShippingServiceCost fields, the seller can indicate that local pickup is an available option and that no is fee charged. This is the equivalent of free shipping.
BestOfferList.ItemArray.Item
  .ShippingDetails
  .ShippingServiceOptions
  .ShippingService	token	Conditionally	This enumeration value indicates a specific domestic shipping service option being offered by the seller to ship an item to a buyer who is located within the same country as the item. This field is required to identify each domestic shipping service option that is specified with a ShippingServiceOptions container.

For a list of valid ShippingService values, call GeteBayDetails with DetailName set to ShippingServiceDetails. The ShippingServiceDetails.ValidForSellingFlow flag must also be present. Otherwise, that particular shipping service option is no longer valid and cannot be offered to buyers through a listing.

To view the full list of domestic shipping service options in the response, look for the ShippingServiceDetails.ShippingService fields. Domestic shipping service options will not have a InternationalService = true field, as this indicates that the ShippingService value is an International shipping service option.

Note: The eBay standard envelope (eSE) is a domestic envelope service with tracking through eBay. This service applies to specific sub-categories of Trading Cards, and to coins & paper money, postcards, stamps, patches, and similar eligible categories, and is only available on the US marketplace. See eBay standard envelope for details, restrictions, and an envelope size template. To use this service, send envelopes using the USPS mail and set the ShippingService field to US_eBayStandardEnvelope.

For the REST equivalent, see Using the eBay standard envelope (eSE) service.

  .ShippingDetails
  .ShippingServiceOptions
  .ShippingServiceAdditionalCost	AmountType (double)	Conditionally	The cost of shipping each additional item if the same buyer purchases multiple quantity of the same line item. This field is required when creating a multiple-quantity, fixed-price listing. Generally, the seller will give the buyer a shipping discount if that buyer purchases multiple quantity of the item, so this value should usually be less than the value set for ShippingServiceCost.

The value of this field can even be set to 0 if the seller wants to encourage buyers to buy multiple quantity of the item, or it could be that the seller can fit multiple quantities of the line item in a single shipping package, so the seller is just passing this shipping savings onto the buyer. This field is not applicable for single-quantity listings.

  .ShippingServiceCost	AmountType (double)	Conditionally	The base cost of shipping one unit of the item using the shipping service specified in the corresponding ShippingService field.

In the case of a multiple-quantity, fixed-price listing, the ShippingServiceAdditionalCost field also becomes applicable, and shows the cost to ship each additional unit of the item if the buyer purchases multiple quantity of the same line item.

Note: If the corresponding shipping service option is set as a 'free shipping' option (FreeShipping set to true) and flat-rate shipping is being used domestically (ShippingType is set to Flat or FlatDomesticCalculatedInternational), the seller must still include this ShippingServiceCost field and set its value to 0.0, as eBay will not do this automatically. Do not include ShippingServiceCost when the domestic shipping service option is set to represent domestic calculated shipping (ShippingType is set to Calculated or CalculatedDomesticFlatInternational), as error 10019 occurs.

When returned by GetItemShipping, it includes the packaging and handling cost.

Note that if ShippingService is set to LocalPickup, ShippingServiceCost must be set to 0.0. Also, if a shipping service has been specified (even LocalPickup), GetItem returns the shipping service cost, even if the cost is zero.

If this is for calculated shipping for a listing that has not yet ended, note that the cost cannot be determined until the listing has ended and the buyer has specified a postal code.

Note that if ShippingService is set to LocalPickup, ShippingServiceCost must be set to 0.0. Also, if a shipping service has been specified (even LocalPickup), GetItem returns the shipping service cost, even if the cost is zero.

If this is for calculated shipping for a listing that has not yet ended, note that the cost cannot be determined until the listing has ended and the buyer has specified a postal code.

  .ShippingDetails
  .ShippingServiceOptions
  .ShippingServicePriority	int	Conditionally	Controls the order (relative to other shipping services) in which the corresponding ShippingService will appear in the View Item and Checkout page.

Sellers can specify up to four domestic shipping services (with four ShippingServiceOptions containers), so valid values are 1, 2, 3, and 4. A shipping service with a ShippingServicePriority value of 1 appears at the top. Conversely, a shipping service with a ShippingServicePriority value of 4 appears at the bottom of a list of four shipping service options.

If this field is omitted from domestic shipping service options, the order of the shipping service options in View Item and Checkout pages will be determined by the order that these shipping service options are presented in the request payload of an Add/Revise/Relist call.

This maximum shipping time does not include the seller's handling time, and the clock starts on the shipping time only after the seller has delivered the item to the shipping carrier for shipment to the buyer. 'Business days' can vary by shipping carrier and by country, but 'business days' are generally Monday through Friday, excluding holidays. This field is returned if defined for that particular shipping service option.

This field is returned if defined for that particular shipping service option.
BestOfferList.ItemArray.Item
  .ShippingDetails.ShippingType	ShippingTypeCodeType	Conditionally	The shipping cost model offered by the seller. This is not returned for various calls since shipping type can be deduced: if a CalculatedShippingRate structure is returned by the call, the shipping type is Calculated. Otherwise, it is one of the other non-Calculated shipping types.

GetItemShipping and GetItemTransactions: If the type was a mix of flat and calculated services, this is set simply to Flat or Calculated because it is the buyer's selection that results in one of these.

GetMyeBayBuying: If the seller has set the ShipToLocation to Worldwide for an item, but has not specified any international shipping service options, NotSpecified is returned as the ShippingType value.

Applicable values: See ShippingType.

BestOfferList.ItemArray.Item
  .Site	SiteCodeType	Conditionally	The name of the eBay listing site. The listing site affects the business logic and validation rules that are applied to the request, which in turn affect the values that are returned in the response, as well as values that appear on the eBay site. For example, the listing site can affect the validation of Category in listing requests, international business seller requirements, the values of converted (localized) prices in responses, the item-related time stamps that are displayed on the eBay site, the visibility of the item in some types of searches (e.g., GetCategoryListings), and other information. In some cases, the rules are determined by a combination of the site, the user's registration address, and other information. You cannot change the site when you revise a listing.

When you specify Item.Site in AddItem or AddFixedPriceItem, it must be consistent with the numeric site ID that you specify in the request URL (for the SOAP API) or the X-EBAY-API-SITEID header (for the XML API).

BestOfferList.ItemArray.Item
  .Title	string	Conditionally	This field is used to specify the title of the listing. This field is conditionally required in an Add call unless the seller successfully uses the ProductListingDetails container to find an eBay catalog product match. When the seller successfully uses an eBay catalog product to create a listing, the listing title, listing description, Item Specifics, and stock photo defined in the catalog product are used to create the listing.

You cannot use HTML or JavaScript in the Title. (HTML characters will be interpreted literally as plain text.)

The listing title can only be changed if the active listing has yet to have any bids or sales, and the listing does not end within 12 hours.
Note: When making a GetSellerEvents call, this field will be returned masked as ***************** for on-hold listings.
Note: When making a GetSellerTransactions or GetMyeBaySelling call, the item ID value of the listing will be returned in this field to indicate that the listing is on hold.
Note: When a line item comes from a multiple-variation listing, the variation aspect name-value pair will be appended to this title.

repeatable: [0..*]	Contains the data properties that define one item listing. GetSellerEvents and GetSellerList only return items if any are available for the seller within the time window specified in the request.

Some optional fields are only returned if the seller defined them for the item. Some fields are only returned under particular conditions specified in the individual field descriptions. For example, a buyer's contact information might only be returned if the member who is making the request (as identified in the eBayAuthToken) has an order relationship with that buyer.

For calls that support detail levels, the set of fields returned is also controlled by the value of DetailLevel in the request. For some calls, other parameters in the request can also control the data returned for each item. For example, GranularityLevel controls the fields to return for each item in the GetSellerList response.
Note: When making a GetSellerList call, items that are on-hold due to an eBay policy violation will not be returned in the response.


DetailLevel: ReturnAll. Also returned if DetailLevel is not provided on input.

DetailLevel: ReturnAll. Also returned if DetailLevel is not provided on input.
BidList.ItemArray.Item
  .BuyItNowPrice	AmountType (double)	Conditionally	This field is only applicable for auction listings. By specifying a 'Buy It Now' price, a seller is allowing prospective buyers the opportunity to purchase the item in the auction listing at this price immediately. When a buyer uses the 'Buy It Now' option to purchase the item, the auction listing will end immediately.

By including this field and specifying a 'Buy It Now' price, the seller is enabling the 'Buy It Now' feature on the auction listing. If the seller includes this field for any other listing type other than an auction, this field and its price will just be ignored.

The price in this field must be at least 30 percent higher than the starting bid price (which is specified in an Add call through the Item.StartPrice field). Once a bid is made on an auction listing, and the bid meets or exceeds the Item.ReservePrice value (if set), the 'Buy It Now' option becomes unavailable, and this field will no longer be applicable. If there is no Reserve Price, the first bid will nullify the 'Buy It Now' option.

Keep in mind that GetItem (and other 'Get' calls that retrieve the Item details) may still return the BuyItNowPrice field for an auction item even if the 'Buy It Now' option is no longer available. Instead, a user should look for the ListingDetails.BuyItNowAvailable boolean field in the GetItem response to determine if the 'Buy It Now' option is still available for the auction item.

Note: For the US site, new eBay sellers are subject to Seller Limits, which limit the quantity of items that may be listed and/or the total cumulative value of these listings. While subject to these selling limits, an eBay seller can use the GetMyeBaySelling call to retrieve both the remaining number of listings they can create and the remaining cumulative value of these listings. These values are shown in the Summary.QuantityLimitRemaining and Summary.AmountLimitRemaining fields in the GetMyeBaySelling response. If a call to add an item or revise an item would result in the exceeding of these limits, the add item or revise item call will fail. These fields will only be returned if the seller is subject to seller limits.


DetailLevel: ReturnAll. Also returned if DetailLevel is not provided on input.
BidList.ItemArray.Item
  .BuyItNowPrice
  [ attribute currencyID ]	CurrencyCodeType	Conditionally	This field is only applicable for auction listings. By specifying a 'Buy It Now' price, a seller is allowing prospective buyers the opportunity to purchase the item in the auction listing at this price immediately. When a buyer uses the 'Buy It Now' option to purchase the item, the auction listing will end immediately.

By including this field and specifying a 'Buy It Now' price, the seller is enabling the 'Buy It Now' feature on the auction listing. If the seller includes this field for any other listing type other than an auction, this field and its price will just be ignored.

The price in this field must be at least 30 percent higher than the starting bid price (which is specified in an Add call through the Item.StartPrice field). Once a bid is made on an auction listing, and the bid meets or exceeds the Item.ReservePrice value (if set), the 'Buy It Now' option becomes unavailable, and this field will no longer be applicable. If there is no Reserve Price, the first bid will nullify the 'Buy It Now' option.

Keep in mind that GetItem (and other 'Get' calls that retrieve the Item details) may still return the BuyItNowPrice field for an auction item even if the 'Buy It Now' option is no longer available. Instead, a user should look for the ListingDetails.BuyItNowAvailable boolean field in the GetItem response to determine if the 'Buy It Now' option is still available for the auction item.

Note: For the US site, new eBay sellers are subject to Seller Limits, which limit the quantity of items that may be listed and/or the total cumulative value of these listings. While subject to these selling limits, an eBay seller can use the GetMyeBaySelling call to retrieve both the remaining number of listings they can create and the remaining cumulative value of these listings. These values are shown in the Summary.QuantityLimitRemaining and Summary.AmountLimitRemaining fields in the GetMyeBaySelling response. If a call to add an item or revise an item would result in the exceeding of these limits, the add item or revise item call will fail. These fields will only be returned if the seller is subject to seller limits.


For a list of possible enumeration values, see CurrencyCodeType.

Motor vehicle listings are an exception. The number of included pictures in motor vehicle listings depend on the selected vehicle package (see Fees for selling vehicles on eBay Motors). These photos can be hosted by eBay Picture Services (EPS), or the seller can host pictures on a non-eBay server. If pictures are externally-hosted, they must be hosted on a site that is using the 'https' protocol.

It is required that all listings have at least one picture.

Not supported as input in ReviseItem. Use SetUserNotes instead.

For GetMyeBayBuying In WatchList, notes for variations are only returned at the Item level, not the variation level. They are only set if you specified ItemID (if no purchases) or ItemID and VariationSpecifics (if there are purchases) in SetUserNotes (or selected the equivalent in the My eBay UI on the site).

In WonList, notes for variations are only returned at the Item level, not the variation level. They are only set if you specified ItemID and TransactionID in SetUserNotes (or selected the equivalent in the My eBay UI on the site).

DetailLevel: ReturnAll. Also returned if DetailLevel is not provided on input.
BidList.ItemArray.Item.Seller
  .FeedbackScore	int	Conditionally	The aggregate feedback score for a user. A user's feedback score is the net positive feedback minus the net negative feedback left for the user. Feedback scores are a quantitative expression of the desirability of dealing with a user as a buyer or a seller in either side of an order.

Each order line item can result in one feedback entry for a given user (the buyer can leave feedback for the seller, and the seller can leave feedback for the buyer.). That one feedback can be positive, negative, or neutral. The aggregated feedback counts for a particular user represent that user's overall feedback score (referred to as a "feedback rating" on the eBay site).

If the user has chosen to make their feedback private and that user is not the user identified in the request's authentication token, FeedbackScore is not returned and FeedbackPrivate is returned with a value of true.

In GetMyeBayBuying and GetMyeBaySelling, feedback information (FeedbackScore and FeedbackRatingStar) is returned in BidList.ItemArray.Item.Seller. For GetMyeBayBuying, the feedback score of each seller with an item having received a bid from the buyer is returned. For GetMyeBaySelling, the feedback score of the seller is returned.

GetMyeBayBuying and GetMyeBaySelling also return feedback information (FeedbackScore and FeedbackRatingStar) in BidList.ItemArray.Item.SellingStatus.HighBidder. GetMyeBayBuying returns feedback information on the high bidder of each item the buyer is bidding on. GetMyeBaySelling returns feedback information on the high bidder of each item the seller is selling.

Since a bidder's user info is anonymous, the real feedback score will be returned only to that bidder, and to the seller of an item that the user is bidding on. For all other users, the value -99 is returned.

For GetOrders and GetItemTransactions only: If using Trading WSDL Version 1019 or above, this field will only be returned to the buyer or seller, and no longer returned at all to third parties. If using a Trading WSDL older than Version 1019, the accurate Feedback Score for the user is returned to the buyer or seller, but a dummy value of 0 will be returned to all third parties.

Note: Effective September 26, 2025, select developers will no longer receive username data for U.S. users through this field. Instead, an immutable user ID will be returned in its place. For more information, please refer to Data Handling Compliance.

Since a bidder's user info is anonymous, this tag contains the actual value of an ID only for that bidder, and for the seller of an item that the user is bidding on. For other users, the actual value is replaced by an anonymous value, according to these rules:

When bidding on items, UserID is replaced with the value "a****b" where a and b are random characters from the UserID. For example, if the UserID = IBidALot, it might be displayed as, "I****A".

Important: In this format, the anonymous bidder ID can change for each auction.
For GetMyeBayBuying only, when bidding on items: UserID is replaced with the value "a****b" where a and b are random characters from the UserID.

When bidding on items listed on the Philippines site: UserID is replaced with the value "Bidder X" where X is a number indicating the order of that user's first bid. For example, if the user was the third bidder, UserID = Bidder 3. Note that in this Philippines site format, the anonymous bidder ID stays the same for a given auction, but is different for different auctions. For example, a bidder who is the third and then the seventh bidder in an auction will be listed for both bids as "Bidder 3". However, if that same bidder is the first bidder on a different auction, the bidder will be listed for that auction as "Bidder 1", not "Bidder 3".

For GetMyeBayBuying only, when bidding on items listed on the UK and AU sites: UserID is replaced with the string "High Bidder".

For ended, single-item, fixed-price listings, this field is a container for the user ID of the purchaser. This field isn't returned for auctions with no bids, or for active fixed-price listings.

In the case of PlaceOffer, for auction listings, this field is a container for the high bidder's user ID. In the PlaceOffer response, the following applies: For multiple-quantity, fixed-price listings, the high bidder is only returned if there is just one order line item (or only for the first order line item that is created).

DetailLevel: ReturnAll. Also returned if DetailLevel is not provided on input.
BidList.ItemArray.Item
  .SellingStatus.HighBidder
  .FeedbackScore	int	Conditionally	The aggregate feedback score for a user. A user's feedback score is the net positive feedback minus the net negative feedback left for the user. Feedback scores are a quantitative expression of the desirability of dealing with a user as a buyer or a seller in either side of an order.

Each order line item can result in one feedback entry for a given user (the buyer can leave feedback for the seller, and the seller can leave feedback for the buyer.). That one feedback can be positive, negative, or neutral. The aggregated feedback counts for a particular user represent that user's overall feedback score (referred to as a "feedback rating" on the eBay site).

If the user has chosen to make their feedback private and that user is not the user identified in the request's authentication token, FeedbackScore is not returned and FeedbackPrivate is returned with a value of true.

In GetMyeBayBuying and GetMyeBaySelling, feedback information (FeedbackScore and FeedbackRatingStar) is returned in BidList.ItemArray.Item.Seller. For GetMyeBayBuying, the feedback score of each seller with an item having received a bid from the buyer is returned. For GetMyeBaySelling, the feedback score of the seller is returned.

GetMyeBayBuying and GetMyeBaySelling also return feedback information (FeedbackScore and FeedbackRatingStar) in BidList.ItemArray.Item.SellingStatus.HighBidder. GetMyeBayBuying returns feedback information on the high bidder of each item the buyer is bidding on. GetMyeBaySelling returns feedback information on the high bidder of each item the seller is selling.

Since a bidder's user info is anonymous, the real feedback score will be returned only to that bidder, and to the seller of an item that the user is bidding on. For all other users, the value -99 is returned.

For GetOrders and GetItemTransactions only: If using Trading WSDL Version 1019 or above, this field will only be returned to the buyer or seller, and no longer returned at all to third parties. If using a Trading WSDL older than Version 1019, the accurate Feedback Score for the user is returned to the buyer or seller, but a dummy value of 0 will be returned to all third parties.

BidList.ItemArray.Item
  .ShippingDetails	ShippingDetailsType	Conditionally	The shipping-related details for an order, including flat and calculated shipping costs.

Note: For sellers who are using a shipping (aka Fulfillment) business policy to create/revise/relist an item, none of the fields under the ShippingDetails container are necessary. A fulfillment business policy can be set up and/or modified in My eBay, or via the Account API. A fulfillment business policy is associated to a listing through the Item.SellerProfiles.SellerShippingProfile container.

If you do not use a fulfillment business policy, many of the fields under this ShippingDetails container become required in your request.
Note: For ReviseItem and ReviseFixedPriceItem calls: If you are updating any field under the ShippingDetails container, you must include all containers and fields set under this container even if their values are not changing. If you do not do this, some fields may be removed from the listing. To find out the values included in the current listing, call GetItem and look through the ShippingDetails container in the response. For additional information, see Revise shipping details.
New users who list their first items in selected categories on the US site must specify at least one domestic shipping service. This applies to a category if GetCategoryFeatures returns true for Category.ShippingTermsRequired.

For multi-quantity, fixed-price listings, a seller can revise all shipping details of the listing (except for sales tax and for shipping type of Freight) for all unsold items. This applies to both domestic and international shipping. Checkout is not affected for those who bought items prior to the seller's shipping changes—the shipping details that were in effect at the time of purchase are used for that buyer at the time of checkout.

Shipping details are not applicable to any classified ad listings, as shipping/delivery/pickup is handled by the buyer and seller off of the eBay platform.

Note: To create a listing that is 'Local Pickup only' (buyer picks up, with no shipping/delivery available), the user does the following two things:
Either omit the entire ShippingDetails container, or pass in an empty ShippingDetails container - <ShippingDetails/>
Pass in one ShipToLocations field, with its value set to None - <ShipToLocations>None</ShipToLocations>

For GetMyeBayBuying, GetMyeBaySelling: ShippingDetails is not returned.

  .ShippingDetails
  .InternationalShippingServiceOption	InternationalShippingServiceOptionsType	Conditionally,
repeatable: [0..*]	Shipping costs and options related to an international shipping service. If used, at least one domestic shipping service must also be provided in ShippingServiceOptions.

If you specify multiple InternationalShippingServiceOption nodes, the repeating nodes must be contiguous. That is, you cannot insert other nodes between InternationalShippingServiceOption nodes.

All specified domestic and international shipping services must be the same shipping type (for example, Flat versus Calculated).

A seller can offer up to four domestic shipping services and up to five international shipping services. However, if the seller is opted in to the Global Shipping Program or eBay International Shipping, only four other international shipping services may be offered (regardless of whether or not Global Shipping or eBay International Shipping is offered for the listing).

If you specify ShippingDetails when you revise or relist an item but you omit InternationalShippingServiceOption, eBay will drop the international shipping services (except the Global Shipping Program or eBay International Shipping) from the listing. This may also have unintended side effects, as other fields that depend on this data may be dropped as well. To retain the shipping services and dependent fields when you modify other shipping details, it may be simplest to specify all ShippingDetails that you still want to include in the listing.

For GetItemShipping, results are filtered: if any service is not available in the buyer's region, it is removed. If no services remain after this filtering, a warning is returned.

DetailLevel: ReturnAll. Also returned if DetailLevel is not provided on input.

  .ShippingDetails
  .ShippingServiceOptions	ShippingServiceOptionsType	Conditionally,
repeatable: [0..*]	This container is used to provide details on a specific domestic shipping service option, including the unique identifier of the shipping service option and the costs related to domestic shipping service. A separate ShippingServiceOptions container is needed for each domestic shipping service option that is available to ship the item. Unless a fulfillment business policy is being used, generally at least one ShippingServiceOptions container will be required.

If you specify multiple ShippingServiceOptions nodes, the repeating nodes must be contiguous. For example, you can insert InternationalShippingServiceOption nodes after a list of repeating ShippingServiceOptions nodes, but not between them:

<ShippingServiceOptions>...</ShippingServiceOptions>
<ShippingServiceOptions>...</ShippingServiceOptions>
<ShippingServiceOptions>...</ShippingServiceOptions>
<InternationalShippingServiceOption>...</InternationalShippingServiceOption>
<InternationalShippingServiceOption>...</InternationalShippingServiceOption>

If you specify ShippingDetails when you revise or relist an item but you omit ShippingServiceOptions, eBay will drop the domestic shipping services from the listing. This may also have unintended side effects, as other fields that depend on this data may be dropped as well.

To retain the shipping services and dependent fields when you modify other shipping details, it may be simplest to specify all ShippingDetails that you still want to include in the listing.

A seller can offer up to four domestic shipping services and up to five international shipping services. However, if the seller is opted in to the Global Shipping Program or eBay International Shipping, only four other international shipping services may be offered (regardless of whether or not Global Shipping shipment or eBay International Shipping is offered for the listing). All specified domestic and international shipping services must be the same shipping type (for example, Flat versus Calculated).

Note: If the seller has set the shipping cost model to 'Flat' or 'Calculated' (ShippingDetails.ShippingType field), at least one actual shipping service option must be specified through a ShippingServiceOptions container. In the past, eBay allowed users to set the shipping cost model to 'Flat' or 'Calculated', and then just pass in one ShippingServiceOptions container with the ShippingServiceOptions.ShipppingService value set to a 'Local Pickup' option. Now, sellers must pass in at least one actual domestic shipping service option in addition to any 'Local Pickup' option, or the listing will be blocked with the following error: 17510 - You must specify at least one domestic shipping service, other than or in addition to Local Pickup.

For GetItemShipping, results are filtered: if any service is not available in the buyer's region, it is removed. If no services remain after this filtering, a warning is returned.

  .ShippingDetails
  .ShippingServiceOptions
  .ExpeditedService	boolean	Conditionally	This field is returned as true if the domestic shipping service is considered an expedited shipping service. An expedited service is typically a shipping service that can ship an order that will arrive at the buyer's location within one to two business days.
BidList.ItemArray.Item
  .ShippingDetails
  .ShippingServiceOptions
  .FreeShipping	boolean	Conditionally	This boolean field indicates whether or not the corresponding domestic shipping service option is free to the buyer. In an Add/Revise/Relist call, free shipping can only be offered for the first specified shipping service (so, the corresponding ShippingServicePriority value should be 1 or included first in the call request). If 'free shipping' is for any other shipping service, this field is ignored.

For 'Get' calls, including GetItem, this field is only returned if 1.
Note: If a seller is specifying a shipping service option as 'free shipping', in addition to this FreeShipping boolean field, the seller will also need to include the corresponding ShippingServiceCost field and set its value to 0.0, as eBay will not do this automatically.
Note: If the condition is certified refurbished (ConditionID set to 2000, 'Certified - Refurbished'), you must offer a free shipping option. Set FreeShipping as true (or 1) along with the ShippingServiceCost as 0.0 for the first domestic shipping service.

  .LocalPickup	boolean	Conditionally	The LocalPickup flag is used by the GetMyEbayBuying and GetMyEbaySelling calls to indicate whether the buyer has selected local pickup as the shipping option or the seller has specified local pickup as the first shipping option. The LocalPickup flag can also be used with other fields to indicate if there is no fee for local pickup.

For example, if the LocalPickup flag is used with the ShippingServiceOptions and ShippingServiceCost fields, the seller can indicate that local pickup is an available option and that no is fee charged. This is the equivalent of free shipping.
BidList.ItemArray.Item
  .ShippingDetails
  .ShippingServiceOptions
  .ShippingService	token	Conditionally	This enumeration value indicates a specific domestic shipping service option being offered by the seller to ship an item to a buyer who is located within the same country as the item. This field is required to identify each domestic shipping service option that is specified with a ShippingServiceOptions container.

For a list of valid ShippingService values, call GeteBayDetails with DetailName set to ShippingServiceDetails. The ShippingServiceDetails.ValidForSellingFlow flag must also be present. Otherwise, that particular shipping service option is no longer valid and cannot be offered to buyers through a listing.

To view the full list of domestic shipping service options in the response, look for the ShippingServiceDetails.ShippingService fields. Domestic shipping service options will not have a InternationalService = true field, as this indicates that the ShippingService value is an International shipping service option.

Note: The eBay standard envelope (eSE) is a domestic envelope service with tracking through eBay. This service applies to specific sub-categories of Trading Cards, and to coins & paper money, postcards, stamps, patches, and similar eligible categories, and is only available on the US marketplace. See eBay standard envelope for details, restrictions, and an envelope size template. To use this service, send envelopes using the USPS mail and set the ShippingService field to US_eBayStandardEnvelope.

  .ShippingServiceAdditionalCost	AmountType (double)	Conditionally	The cost of shipping each additional item if the same buyer purchases multiple quantity of the same line item. This field is required when creating a multiple-quantity, fixed-price listing. Generally, the seller will give the buyer a shipping discount if that buyer purchases multiple quantity of the item, so this value should usually be less than the value set for ShippingServiceCost.

The value of this field can even be set to 0 if the seller wants to encourage buyers to buy multiple quantity of the item, or it could be that the seller can fit multiple quantities of the line item in a single shipping package, so the seller is just passing this shipping savings onto the buyer. This field is not applicable for single-quantity listings.

  .ShippingServiceCost	AmountType (double)	Conditionally	The base cost of shipping one unit of the item using the shipping service specified in the corresponding ShippingService field.

In the case of a multiple-quantity, fixed-price listing, the ShippingServiceAdditionalCost field also becomes applicable, and shows the cost to ship each additional unit of the item if the buyer purchases multiple quantity of the same line item.

Note: If the corresponding shipping service option is set as a 'free shipping' option (FreeShipping set to true) and flat-rate shipping is being used domestically (ShippingType is set to Flat or FlatDomesticCalculatedInternational), the seller must still include this ShippingServiceCost field and set its value to 0.0, as eBay will not do this automatically. Do not include ShippingServiceCost when the domestic shipping service option is set to represent domestic calculated shipping (ShippingType is set to Calculated or CalculatedDomesticFlatInternational), as error 10019 occurs.

When returned by GetItemShipping, it includes the packaging and handling cost.

Note that if ShippingService is set to LocalPickup, ShippingServiceCost must be set to 0.0. Also, if a shipping service has been specified (even LocalPickup), GetItem returns the shipping service cost, even if the cost is zero.

If this is for calculated shipping for a listing that has not yet ended, note that the cost cannot be determined until the listing has ended and the buyer has specified a postal code.

In the case of a multiple-quantity, fixed-price listing, the ShippingServiceAdditionalCost field also becomes applicable, and shows the cost to ship each additional unit of the item if the buyer purchases multiple quantity of the same line item.

Note: If the corresponding shipping service option is set as a 'free shipping' option (FreeShipping set to true) and flat-rate shipping is being used domestically (ShippingType is set to Flat or FlatDomesticCalculatedInternational), the seller must still include this ShippingServiceCost field and set its value to 0.0, as eBay will not do this automatically. Do not include ShippingServiceCost when the domestic shipping service option is set to represent domestic calculated shipping (ShippingType is set to Calculated or CalculatedDomesticFlatInternational), as error 10019 occurs.

When returned by GetItemShipping, it includes the packaging and handling cost.

Note that if ShippingService is set to LocalPickup, ShippingServiceCost must be set to 0.0. Also, if a shipping service has been specified (even LocalPickup), GetItem returns the shipping service cost, even if the cost is zero.

If this is for calculated shipping for a listing that has not yet ended, note that the cost cannot be determined until the listing has ended and the buyer has specified a postal code.

  .ShippingServiceOptions
  .ShippingServicePriority	int	Conditionally	Controls the order (relative to other shipping services) in which the corresponding ShippingService will appear in the View Item and Checkout page.

Sellers can specify up to four domestic shipping services (with four ShippingServiceOptions containers), so valid values are 1, 2, 3, and 4. A shipping service with a ShippingServicePriority value of 1 appears at the top. Conversely, a shipping service with a ShippingServicePriority value of 4 appears at the bottom of a list of four shipping service options.

If this field is omitted from domestic shipping service options, the order of the shipping service options in View Item and Checkout pages will be determined by the order that these shipping service options are presented in the request payload of an Add/Revise/Relist call.

'Business days' can vary by shipping carrier and by country, but 'business days' are generally Monday through Friday, excluding holidays. This field is returned if defined for that particular shipping service option.
BidList.ItemArray.Item
  .ShippingDetails.ShippingType	ShippingTypeCodeType	Conditionally	The shipping cost model offered by the seller. This is not returned for various calls since shipping type can be deduced: if a CalculatedShippingRate structure is returned by the call, the shipping type is Calculated. Otherwise, it is one of the other non-Calculated shipping types.

GetItemShipping and GetItemTransactions: If the type was a mix of flat and calculated services, this is set simply to Flat or Calculated because it is the buyer's selection that results in one of these.

GetMyeBayBuying: If the seller has set the ShipToLocation to Worldwide for an item, but has not specified any international shipping service options, NotSpecified is returned as the ShippingType value.

Applicable values: See ShippingType.
Code so that your app gracefully handles any future changes to this list.
BidList.ItemArray.Item.Site	SiteCodeType	Conditionally	The name of the eBay listing site. The listing site affects the business logic and validation rules that are applied to the request, which in turn affect the values that are returned in the response, as well as values that appear on the eBay site. For example, the listing site can affect the validation of Category in listing requests, international business seller requirements, the values of converted (localized) prices in responses, the item-related time stamps that are displayed on the eBay site, the visibility of the item in some types of searches (e.g., GetCategoryListings), and other information. In some cases, the rules are determined by a combination of the site, the user's registration address, and other information. You cannot change the site when you revise a listing.

When you specify Item.Site in AddItem or AddFixedPriceItem, it must be consistent with the numeric site ID that you specify in the request URL (for the SOAP API) or the X-EBAY-API-SITEID header (for the XML API).

DetailLevel: ReturnAll. Also returned if DetailLevel is not provided on input.
BidList.ItemArray.Item
  .StartPrice	AmountType (double)	Conditionally	The original price of the item at listing or re-listing time. If this value changes when the item is revised, the new value becomes the original price.

For auction listings: Competitive bidding starts at this value. Once at least one bid has been placed, StartPrice remains the same but CurrentPrice is incremented to the amount of each succeeding bid. If ReservePrice is also specified, the value of StartPrice must be lower than the value of ReservePrice.

For input on fixed-price listings (FixedPriceItem): This is the constant price at which a buyer may purchase the item.

GetMyeBaySelling does not return Item.StartPrice for fixed price items—it returns Item.SellingStatus.CurrentPrice.

For AddFixedPriceItem and VerifyAddFixedPriceItem: Required when no variations are specified. If variations are specified, use Variation.StartPrice for each variation instead.

For Revise calls: If the StartPrice value for a fixed-price item is changed with a Revise call, the MinimumBestOfferPrice and BestOfferAutoAcceptPrice fields in the ListingDetails container will be dropped (if set), basically turning off the Best Offer Auto Accept and/or Auto Decline features. If the seller wanted to reintroduce either of these Best Offer threshold values in the listing again, an additional Revise call would have to be made, passing in the desired threshold values.

Note: For the US site, new eBay sellers are subject to Seller Limits, which limit the quantity of items that may be listed and/or the total cumulative value of these listings. While subject to these selling limits, an eBay seller can use the GetMyeBaySelling call to retrieve both the remaining number of listings they can create and the remaining cumulative value of these listings. These values are shown in the Summary.QuantityLimitRemaining and Summary.AmountLimitRemaining fields in the GetMyeBaySelling response. If a call to add an item or revise an item would result in the exceeding of these limits, the add item or revise item call will fail. These fields will only be returned if the seller is subject to seller limits.

  [ attribute currencyID ]	CurrencyCodeType	Conditionally	The original price of the item at listing or re-listing time. If this value changes when the item is revised, the new value becomes the original price.

For auction listings: Competitive bidding starts at this value. Once at least one bid has been placed, StartPrice remains the same but CurrentPrice is incremented to the amount of each succeeding bid. If ReservePrice is also specified, the value of StartPrice must be lower than the value of ReservePrice.

For input on fixed-price listings (FixedPriceItem): This is the constant price at which a buyer may purchase the item.

GetMyeBaySelling does not return Item.StartPrice for fixed price items—it returns Item.SellingStatus.CurrentPrice.

For AddFixedPriceItem and VerifyAddFixedPriceItem: Required when no variations are specified. If variations are specified, use Variation.StartPrice for each variation instead.

For Revise calls: If the StartPrice value for a fixed-price item is changed with a Revise call, the MinimumBestOfferPrice and BestOfferAutoAcceptPrice fields in the ListingDetails container will be dropped (if set), basically turning off the Best Offer Auto Accept and/or Auto Decline features. If the seller wanted to reintroduce either of these Best Offer threshold values in the listing again, an additional Revise call would have to be made, passing in the desired threshold values.

Note: For the US site, new eBay sellers are subject to Seller Limits, which limit the quantity of items that may be listed and/or the total cumulative value of these listings. While subject to these selling limits, an eBay seller can use the GetMyeBaySelling call to retrieve both the remaining number of listings they can create and the remaining cumulative value of these listings. These values are shown in the Summary.QuantityLimitRemaining and Summary.AmountLimitRemaining fields in the GetMyeBaySelling response. If a call to add an item or revise an item would result in the exceeding of these limits, the add item or revise item call will fail. These fields will only be returned if the seller is subject to seller limits.

DeletedFromLostList.ItemArray
  .Item.Seller.FeedbackScore	int	Conditionally	The aggregate feedback score for a user. A user's feedback score is the net positive feedback minus the net negative feedback left for the user. Feedback scores are a quantitative expression of the desirability of dealing with a user as a buyer or a seller in either side of an order.

Each order line item can result in one feedback entry for a given user (the buyer can leave feedback for the seller, and the seller can leave feedback for the buyer.). That one feedback can be positive, negative, or neutral. The aggregated feedback counts for a particular user represent that user's overall feedback score (referred to as a "feedback rating" on the eBay site).

If the user has chosen to make their feedback private and that user is not the user identified in the request's authentication token, FeedbackScore is not returned and FeedbackPrivate is returned with a value of true.

In GetMyeBayBuying and GetMyeBaySelling, feedback information (FeedbackScore and FeedbackRatingStar) is returned in BidList.ItemArray.Item.Seller. For GetMyeBayBuying, the feedback score of each seller with an item having received a bid from the buyer is returned. For GetMyeBaySelling, the feedback score of the seller is returned.

GetMyeBayBuying and GetMyeBaySelling also return feedback information (FeedbackScore and FeedbackRatingStar) in BidList.ItemArray.Item.SellingStatus.HighBidder. GetMyeBayBuying returns feedback information on the high bidder of each item the buyer is bidding on. GetMyeBaySelling returns feedback information on the high bidder of each item the seller is selling.

Since a bidder's user info is anonymous, the real feedback score will be returned only to that bidder, and to the seller of an item that the user is bidding on. For all other users, the value -99 is returned.

For GetOrders and GetItemTransactions only: If using Trading WSDL Version 1019 or above, this field will only be returned to the buyer or seller, and no longer returned at all to third parties. If using a Trading WSDL older than Version 1019, the accurate Feedback Score for the user is returned to the buyer or seller, but a dummy value of 0 will be returned to all third parties.

Note: Effective September 26, 2025, select developers will no longer receive username data for U.S. users through this field. Instead, an immutable user ID will be returned in its place. For more information, please refer to Data Handling Compliance.

Since a bidder's user info is anonymous, this tag contains the actual value of an ID only for that bidder, and for the seller of an item that the user is bidding on. For other users, the actual value is replaced by an anonymous value, according to these rules:

When bidding on items, UserID is replaced with the value "a****b" where a and b are random characters from the UserID. For example, if the UserID = IBidALot, it might be displayed as, "I****A".

Important: In this format, the anonymous bidder ID can change for each auction.
For GetMyeBayBuying only, when bidding on items: UserID is replaced with the value "a****b" where a and b are random characters from the UserID.

When bidding on items listed on the Philippines site: UserID is replaced with the value "Bidder X" where X is a number indicating the order of that user's first bid. For example, if the user was the third bidder, UserID = Bidder 3. Note that in this Philippines site format, the anonymous bidder ID stays the same for a given auction, but is different for different auctions. For example, a bidder who is the third and then the seventh bidder in an auction will be listed for both bids as "Bidder 3". However, if that same bidder is the first bidder on a different auction, the bidder will be listed for that auction as "Bidder 1", not "Bidder 3".

For GetMyeBayBuying only, when bidding on items listed on the UK and AU sites: UserID is replaced with the string "High Bidder".

To find out the values included in the current listing, call GetItem and look through the ShippingDetails container in the response. For additional information, see Revise shipping details.
New users who list their first items in selected categories on the US site must specify at least one domestic shipping service. This applies to a category if GetCategoryFeatures returns true for Category.ShippingTermsRequired.

For multi-quantity, fixed-price listings, a seller can revise all shipping details of the listing (except for sales tax and for shipping type of Freight) for all unsold items. This applies to both domestic and international shipping. Checkout is not affected for those who bought items prior to the seller's shipping changes—the shipping details that were in effect at the time of purchase are used for that buyer at the time of checkout.

Shipping details are not applicable to any classified ad listings, as shipping/delivery/pickup is handled by the buyer and seller off of the eBay platform.

Note: To create a listing that is 'Local Pickup only' (buyer picks up, with no shipping/delivery available), the user does the following two things:
Either omit the entire ShippingDetails container, or pass in an empty ShippingDetails container - <ShippingDetails/>
Pass in one ShipToLocations field, with its value set to None - <ShipToLocations>None</ShipToLocations>

For GetMyeBayBuying, GetMyeBaySelling: ShippingDetails is not returned.

  .Item.ShippingDetails
  .ShippingType	ShippingTypeCodeType	Conditionally	The shipping cost model offered by the seller. This is not returned for various calls since shipping type can be deduced: if a CalculatedShippingRate structure is returned by the call, the shipping type is Calculated. Otherwise, it is one of the other non-Calculated shipping types.

GetItemShipping and GetItemTransactions: If the type was a mix of flat and calculated services, this is set simply to Flat or Calculated because it is the buyer's selection that results in one of these.

GetMyeBayBuying: If the seller has set the ShipToLocation to Worldwide for an item, but has not specified any international shipping service options, NotSpecified is returned as the ShippingType value.

  .Item.Site	SiteCodeType	Conditionally	The name of the eBay listing site. The listing site affects the business logic and validation rules that are applied to the request, which in turn affect the values that are returned in the response, as well as values that appear on the eBay site. For example, the listing site can affect the validation of Category in listing requests, international business seller requirements, the values of converted (localized) prices in responses, the item-related time stamps that are displayed on the eBay site, the visibility of the item in some types of searches (e.g., GetCategoryListings), and other information. In some cases, the rules are determined by a combination of the site, the user's registration address, and other information. You cannot change the site when you revise a listing.

When you specify Item.Site in AddItem or AddFixedPriceItem, it must be consistent with the numeric site ID that you specify in the request URL (for the SOAP API) or the X-EBAY-API-SITEID header (for the XML API).

  .Item.StartPrice	AmountType (double)	Conditionally	The original price of the item at listing or re-listing time. If this value changes when the item is revised, the new value becomes the original price.

For auction listings: Competitive bidding starts at this value. Once at least one bid has been placed, StartPrice remains the same but CurrentPrice is incremented to the amount of each succeeding bid. If ReservePrice is also specified, the value of StartPrice must be lower than the value of ReservePrice.

For input on fixed-price listings (FixedPriceItem): This is the constant price at which a buyer may purchase the item.

GetMyeBaySelling does not return Item.StartPrice for fixed price items—it returns Item.SellingStatus.CurrentPrice.

For AddFixedPriceItem and VerifyAddFixedPriceItem: Required when no variations are specified. If variations are specified, use Variation.StartPrice for each variation instead.

For Revise calls: If the StartPrice value for a fixed-price item is changed with a Revise call, the MinimumBestOfferPrice and BestOfferAutoAcceptPrice fields in the ListingDetails container will be dropped (if set), basically turning off the Best Offer Auto Accept and/or Auto Decline features. If the seller wanted to reintroduce either of these Best Offer threshold values in the listing again, an additional Revise call would have to be made, passing in the desired threshold values.

Note: For the US site, new eBay sellers are subject to Seller Limits, which limit the quantity of items that may be listed and/or the total cumulative value of these listings. While subject to these selling limits, an eBay seller can use the GetMyeBaySelling call to retrieve both the remaining number of listings they can create and the remaining cumulative value of these listings. These values are shown in the Summary.QuantityLimitRemaining and Summary.AmountLimitRemaining fields in the GetMyeBaySelling response. If a call to add an item or revise an item would result in the exceeding of these limits, the add item or revise item call will fail. These fields will only be returned if the seller is subject to seller limits.

  .Item.Title	string	Conditionally	This field is used to specify the title of the listing. This field is conditionally required in an Add call unless the seller successfully uses the ProductListingDetails container to find an eBay catalog product match. When the seller successfully uses an eBay catalog product to create a listing, the listing title, listing description, Item Specifics, and stock photo defined in the catalog product are used to create the listing.

You cannot use HTML or JavaScript in the Title. (HTML characters will be interpreted literally as plain text.)

The listing title can only be changed if the active listing has yet to have any bids or sales, and the listing does not end within 12 hours.
Note: When making a GetSellerEvents call, this field will be returned masked as ***************** for on-hold listings.
Note: When making a GetSellerTransactions or GetMyeBaySelling call, the item ID value of the listing will be returned in this field to indicate that the listing is on hold.

  .Item.Variations	VariationsType	Conditionally	
Variations are similar (but not identical) items in a multiple-variation, fixed-price listing. For example, a T-shirt listing could contain multiple items of the same brand that vary by color and size (like "Blue, Large" and "Black, Medium"). Each variation specifies a combination of one of these colors and sizes. Each variation can have a different quantity and price. You can buy multiple items from one variation at the same time. (That is, one order line item can contain multiple items from a single variation.)

If you list in two categories, both categories must support listing with variations. See VariationsEnabled in GetCategoryFeatures to determine applicable categories.

For ReviseFixedPriceItem and RelistFixedPriceItem: Once a listing has been submitted with variations, you can't delete all the variations when you revise or relist the listing (because it would be considered a different listing). You also can't add or change variation specifics (because they are unique identifiers). However, you can delete or replace individual variations as needed to match your current inventory. If a variation has no purchases, use the Variation.Delete field to delete the variation. If it has inventory, set the Quantity to 0.

As a best practice, if you want to revise multiple variations in the same listing at the same time (i.e., within a very short period), use a single ReviseFixedPriceItem request and include all the variation revisions in the same request. If your application design requires you to revise each variation individually, then avoid using multiple parallel threads. Instead, use a serial, synchronous process. That is, wait until each revision has been processed by eBay before submitting the next revision request for another variation in the same listing.

For GetItem and related calls Only returned when a listing has variations.

For GetSellerList: Only returned when a listing has variations, IncludeVariations was set to true in the request, the DetailLevel was set to ReturnAll, and an applicable pagination value and time range were specified.

For GetItemTransactions Only returned in Item when a listing has variations and IncludeVariations was set to true in the request. (Also see Variation returned in Transaction for information about which variation was actually purchased.)

For GetSellerEvents, GetMyeBayBuying, and GetMyeBaySelling: Only returned when a listing has variations and HideVariations was set to false or not specified in the request.
Note: This container will stop being returned in GetItemTransactions on January 31, 2024.


DetailLevel: ReturnAll. Also returned if DetailLevel is not provided on input.

DeletedFromLostList.ItemArray
  .Item.Variations.Variation	VariationType	Conditionally,
repeatable: [0..*]	
Contains data that distinguishes one item variation from another. For example, if an item varies by color and size, each Variation node specifies a combination of one of those colors and sizes.

When listing or relisting an item, you are allowed to create a listing with only one item variation, and you might have a plan to add more item variations to the listing in the future. However, if you don't plan to add other item variations in the future, we recommend that you avoid listing with only one variation, so that you avoid confusing buyers.

If you specify multiple Variation containers in an add/revise/relist/verify add call to define multiple item variations, the Variation containers must be contiguous or an error will occur. This means that you would not want to input a Pictures or a VariationSpecificsSet container in between Variation containers in an API call.

When you modify an item variation with a ReviseFixedPriceItem call, the best practice is to include all applicable fields under the Variation container, even if some of the values/settings are not being modified. The StartPrice and VariationSpecifics must be included when modifying an existing item variation, even if these values are not being changed. If a SKU value is defined for the item variation, it is strongly recommended that you include the SKU field, regardless of whether the SKU value is changing or not. If the SKU field is not included, any existing SKU value will be removed from the item variation. It is also strongly recommended that you include the Quantity field and input an accurate value, because if the Quantity field is omitted in the API call, the quantity for the item variation is set to 0.
Note: The Item.Variations container and its child fields will stop being returned in GetItemTransactions on January 31, 2024.

  .Item.Variations.Variation
  .VariationSpecifics	NameValueListArrayType	Conditionally,
repeatable: [2..5]	
A list of name/value pairs that uniquely identify the variation within the listing. All variations must specify the same set of Item Specific names, but each variation must provide a unique combination of values for those Item Specific names. For example, if the items vary by color and size, then every variation must specify 'Color' and 'Size' as Item Specific names, but no two variations can specify the same combination of 'Color' and 'Size' values.

When you revise a listing that includes variations, you can change names of Variationpecifics by using the Variations.ModifyNameList container. You can also add, delete, or replace individual variations as needed to match your current inventory. Use the Variation.Delete field to delete a variation that has no sales (order line items). If the variation has sales, then set the Quantity to 0.

For GetSellerEvents To keep the GetSellerEvents response smaller, Variationpecifics are not returned if the variation has a SKU. If the variation has no SKU, then Variationpecifics are returned instead. Optionally, you can pass IncludeVariationSpecifics as true in the request to force Variationpecifics to be returned, even when the SKU is returned.
Note: The Item.Variations container and its child fields will stop being returned in GetItemTransactions on January 31, 2024.

For the AddFixedPriceItem family of calls: The same NameValueList schema is used for the ItemSpecifics node, the VariationSpecifics node, and the VariationSpecifcsSet node.

If the listing has variations, any name that you use in the VariationSpecifics and VariationSpecificsSet nodes can't be used in the ItemSpecifics node.
When you list with Item Variations:
Specify shared Item Specifics (e.g., Brand) in the ItemSpecifics node.
Specify up to five VariationSpecifics in each Variation node.
Specify all applicable names with all their supported values in the VariationSpecificSet node.
See the Variation sample in the AddFixedPriceItem call reference for examples.

For PlaceOffer: Required if the item being purchased includes Item Variations.

For AddToWatchList and RemoveFromWatchList: The ItemID value of the multiple-variation listing and the name-value pair to identify each variation in the listing are required.

Note: As of August 30, 2018, California will require sellers to display a Proposition 65 warning on online retail sites if products contain chemicals and/or substances that may impact the health of California buyers. This requirement is applicable to most eBay US categories, including eBay Motors, Motors Parts & Accessories, and catalog-enabled categories. The warning message can be customized by the seller, but should contain the following basic information:
The name of at least one listed chemical that prompted the warning
Text stating that the product 'can expose you to' the chemical(s) in the product
The URL for OEHHA's new Proposition 65 warnings website, which is www.P65Warnings.ca.gov
Unlike standard item specifics that allow a maximum of 65 characters in the Value field, the matching value for the 'California Prop 65 Warning' item specific allows up to 800 characters of text. When a seller passes in this item specific, eBay will automatically insert a warning symbol icon for the listing.

  .VariationSpecifics
  .NameValueList.Name	string	Conditionally	Depending on the call and context, this value is either a name of an Item/Variation Specific, or a Parts Compatibility name.

For the AddItem and AddFixedPriceItem families of calls: In the Item.ItemSpecifics context, the value in this field will either be the name of a required/recommended/optional item specific name for the category, or it may be a seller's customized item specific name.

For the AddFixedPriceItem family of calls: In the Compatibility.NameValueList context, this value is a motor vehicle aspect such as Year, Make, and Model. A Compatibility.NameValueList container is applicable for motor vehicle parts and accessories listings.

For PlaceOffer: Required if the line item being purchased is an item variation within a multiple-variation listing.

Note: For required and recommended item specifics that are returned in the getItemAspectsForCategory method of the Taxonomy API, the seller should pass in the name of these item specifics just as they are shown in the getItemAspectsForCategory response. Similarly, for catalog-enabled categories, the seller should pass in the name of instance aspects just as they are shown in the getItemAspectsForCategory response. Instance aspects are additional details unique to a specific item or listing that a seller can include along with the product aspects that are already defined in the eBay catalog product associated with the listing. Instance aspects common to many catalog-enabled categories include 'Bundle Description' and 'Modification Description'. eBay US sellers who ship to California are required to pass in a 'California Prop 65 Warning' item specific if the item in the listing contains one or more chemicals known to be harmful to human health. This item specific is passed at the listing level for both single-variation and multiple-variation listings. The 'California Prop 65 Warning' is considered an instance specific because it will be retained on the listing even when the seller lists using an eBay catalog product. The 'California Prop 65 Warning' may be applicable in most eBay US categories, including eBay Motors, Motors Parts & Accessories, and catalog-enabled categories.
Note: If Brand and MPN (Manufacturer Part Number) are being used to identify product variations in a multiple-variation listing, the Brand must be specified at the item level (ItemSpecifics container) and the MPN for each product variation must be specified at the variation level (VariationSpecifics container). The Brand name must be the same for all variations within a single listing.

For the AddItem family of calls: Multiple values can only be specified for an Item Specific if the itemToAspectCardinality field of the getItemAspectsForCategory method shows a value of MULTI. If an item specific only supports a single value, only the first item specific value specified in the request will be used.

For the Compatibility.NameValueList context, this is the corresponding value of a motor vehicle aspect such as Year, Make, and Model. A Compatibility.NameValueList container is applicable for motor vehicle parts and accessories listings.

For PlaceOffer: Required if the line item being purchased is an item variation within a multiple-variation listing.

Note: The standard maximum length for the value of an item specific is 65, but the maximum allowed length increases for instance aspects such as 'Bundle Description' and 'Modification Description'. For item specifics with max lengths greater than 65, the actual max length will be returned in a corresponding aspectMaxLength field. The maximum allowed length for the new 'California Prop 65 Warning' item specific is 800 characters. For more information about the 'California Prop 65 Warning' item specific, see the ItemSpecifics.NameValueList field description.

  .InternationalShippingServiceOption	InternationalShippingServiceOptionsType	Conditionally,
repeatable: [0..*]	Shipping costs and options related to an international shipping service. If used, at least one domestic shipping service must also be provided in ShippingServiceOptions.

If you specify multiple InternationalShippingServiceOption nodes, the repeating nodes must be contiguous. That is, you cannot insert other nodes between InternationalShippingServiceOption nodes.

All specified domestic and international shipping services must be the same shipping type (for example, Flat versus Calculated).

A seller can offer up to four domestic shipping services and up to five international shipping services. However, if the seller is opted in to the Global Shipping Program or eBay International Shipping, only four other international shipping services may be offered (regardless of whether or not Global Shipping or eBay International Shipping is offered for the listing).

If you specify ShippingDetails when you revise or relist an item but you omit InternationalShippingServiceOption, eBay will drop the international shipping services (except the Global Shipping Program or eBay International Shipping) from the listing. This may also have unintended side effects, as other fields that depend on this data may be dropped as well. To retain the shipping services and dependent fields when you modify other shipping details, it may be simplest to specify all ShippingDetails that you still want to include in the listing.

For GetItemShipping, results are filtered: if any service is not available in the buyer's region, it is removed. If no services remain after this filtering, a warning is returned.

repeatable: [0..*]	This container is used to provide details on a specific domestic shipping service option, including the unique identifier of the shipping service option and the costs related to domestic shipping service. A separate ShippingServiceOptions container is needed for each domestic shipping service option that is available to ship the item. Unless a fulfillment business policy is being used, generally at least one ShippingServiceOptions container will be required.

If you specify multiple ShippingServiceOptions nodes, the repeating nodes must be contiguous. For example, you can insert InternationalShippingServiceOption nodes after a list of repeating ShippingServiceOptions nodes, but not between them:

<ShippingServiceOptions>...</ShippingServiceOptions>
<ShippingServiceOptions>...</ShippingServiceOptions>

<InternationalShippingServiceOption>...</InternationalShippingServiceOption>

All specified domestic and international shipping services must be the same shipping type (for example, Flat versus Calculated).

Note: If the seller has set the shipping cost model to 'Flat' or 'Calculated' (ShippingDetails.ShippingType field), at least one actual shipping service option must be specified through a ShippingServiceOptions container. In the past, eBay allowed users to set the shipping cost model to 'Flat' or 'Calculated', and then just pass in one ShippingServiceOptions container with the ShippingServiceOptions.ShipppingService value set to a 'Local Pickup' option. Now, sellers must pass in at least one actual domestic shipping service option in addition to any 'Local Pickup' option, or the listing will be blocked with the following error: 17510 - You must specify at least one domestic shipping service, other than or in addition to Local Pickup.

If 'free shipping' is for any other shipping service, this field is ignored.

For 'Get' calls, including GetItem, this field is only returned if 1.
Note: If a seller is specifying a shipping service option as 'free shipping', in addition to this FreeShipping boolean field, the seller will also need to include the corresponding ShippingServiceCost field and set its value to 0.0, as eBay will not do this automatically.
Note: If the condition is certified refurbished (ConditionID set to 2000, 'Certified - Refurbished'), you must offer a free shipping option. Set FreeShipping as true (or 1) along with the ShippingServiceCost as 0.0 for the first domestic shipping service.

For a list of valid ShippingService values, call GeteBayDetails with DetailName set to ShippingServiceDetails. The ShippingServiceDetails.ValidForSellingFlow flag must also be present. Otherwise, that particular shipping service option is no longer valid and cannot be offered to buyers through a listing.

To view the full list of domestic shipping service options in the response, look for the ShippingServiceDetails.ShippingService fields. Domestic shipping service options will not have a InternationalService = true field, as this indicates that the ShippingService value is an International shipping service option.

This service applies to specific sub-categories of Trading Cards, and to coins & paper money, postcards, stamps, patches, and similar eligible categories, and is only available on the US marketplace.

Note: If the corresponding shipping service option is set as a 'free shipping' option (FreeShipping set to true) and flat-rate shipping is being used domestically (ShippingType is set to Flat or FlatDomesticCalculatedInternational), the seller must still include this ShippingServiceCost field and set its value to 0.0, as eBay will not do this automatically.

Based on Trust and Safety policies, the time is unspecified and can vary by site.

Since a bidder's user info is anonymous, this tag will be returned only to that bidder, and to the seller of an item that the user is bidding on.

Note: Effective September 26, 2025, select developers will no longer receive username data for U.S. users through this field. Instead, an immutable user ID will be returned in its place. For more information, please refer to Data Handling Compliance.

Since a bidder's user info is anonymous, this tag contains the actual value of an ID only for that bidder, and for the seller of an item that the user is bidding on. For other users, the actual value is replaced by an anonymous value, according to these rules:

When bidding on items, UserID is replaced with the value "a****b" where a and b are random characters from the UserID. For example, if the UserID = IBidALot, it might be displayed as, "I****A".

Important: In this format, the anonymous bidder ID can change for each auction.
For GetMyeBayBuying only, when bidding on items: UserID is replaced with the value "a****b" where a and b are random characters from the UserID.

When bidding on items listed on the Philippines site: UserID is replaced with the value "Bidder X" where X is a number indicating the order of that user's first bid. For example, if the user was the third bidder, UserID = Bidder 3. Note that in this Philippines site format, the anonymous bidder ID stays the same for a given auction, but is different for different auctions. For example, a bidder who is the third and then the seventh bidder in an auction will be listed for both bids as "Bidder 3". However, if that same bidder is the first bidder on a different auction, the bidder will be listed for that auction as "Bidder 1", not "Bidder 3".

For GetMyeBayBuying only, when bidding on items listed on the UK and AU sites: UserID is replaced with the string "High Bidder".

Note: For sellers who are using a shipping (aka Fulfillment) business policy to create/revise/relist an item, none of the fields under the ShippingDetails container are necessary. A fulfillment business policy can be set up and/or modified in My eBay, or via the Account API. A fulfillment business policy is associated to a listing through the Item.SellerProfiles.SellerShippingProfile container.

If you do not use a fulfillment business policy, many of the fields under this ShippingDetails container become required in your request.
Note: For ReviseItem and ReviseFixedPriceItem calls: If you are updating any field under the ShippingDetails container, you must include all containers and fields set under this container even if their values are not changing. If you do not do this, some fields may be removed from the listing. To find out the values included in the current listing, call GetItem and look through the ShippingDetails container in the response. For additional information, see Revise shipping details.
New users who list their first items in selected categories on the US site must specify at least one domestic shipping service. This applies to a category if GetCategoryFeatures returns true for Category.ShippingTermsRequired.

For multi-quantity, fixed-price listings, a seller can revise all shipping details of the listing (except for sales tax and for shipping type of Freight) for all unsold items. This applies to both domestic and international shipping. Checkout is not affected for those who bought items prior to the seller's shipping changes—the shipping details that were in effect at the time of purchase are used for that buyer at the time of checkout.

Shipping details are not applicable to any classified ad listings, as shipping/delivery/pickup is handled by the buyer and seller off of the eBay platform.

Note: To create a listing that is 'Local Pickup only' (buyer picks up, with no shipping/delivery available), the user does the following two things:
Either omit the entire ShippingDetails container, or pass in an empty ShippingDetails container - <ShippingDetails/>
Pass in one ShipToLocations field, with its value set to None - <ShipToLocations>None</ShipToLocations>

For GetMyeBayBuying, GetMyeBaySelling: ShippingDetails is not returned.

If you specify multiple InternationalShippingServiceOption nodes, the repeating nodes must be contiguous. That is, you cannot insert other nodes between InternationalShippingServiceOption nodes.

All specified domestic and international shipping services must be the same shipping type (for example, Flat versus Calculated).

A seller can offer up to four domestic shipping services and up to five international shipping services. However, if the seller is opted in to the Global Shipping Program or eBay International Shipping, only four other international shipping services may be offered (regardless of whether or not Global Shipping or eBay International Shipping is offered for the listing).

If you specify ShippingDetails when you revise or relist an item but you omit InternationalShippingServiceOption, eBay will drop the international shipping services (except the Global Shipping Program or eBay International Shipping) from the listing. This may also have unintended side effects, as other fields that depend on this data may be dropped as well. To retain the shipping services and dependent fields when you modify other shipping details, it may be simplest to specify all ShippingDetails that you still want to include in the listing.

For GetItemShipping, results are filtered: if any service is not available in the buyer's region, it is removed. If no services remain after this filtering, a warning is returned.

A separate ShippingServiceOptions container is needed for each domestic shipping service option that is available to ship the item. Unless a fulfillment business policy is being used, generally at least one ShippingServiceOptions container will be required.

If you specify multiple ShippingServiceOptions nodes, the repeating nodes must be contiguous. For example, you can insert InternationalShippingServiceOption nodes after a list of repeating ShippingServiceOptions nodes, but not between them:

All specified domestic and international shipping services must be the same shipping type (for example, Flat versus Calculated).

Note: If the seller has set the shipping cost model to 'Flat' or 'Calculated' (ShippingDetails.ShippingType field), at least one actual shipping service option must be specified through a ShippingServiceOptions container. In the past, eBay allowed users to set the shipping cost model to 'Flat' or 'Calculated', and then just pass in one ShippingServiceOptions container with the ShippingServiceOptions.ShipppingService value set to a 'Local Pickup' option. Now, sellers must pass in at least one actual domestic shipping service option in addition to any 'Local Pickup' option, or the listing will be blocked with the following error: 17510 - You must specify at least one domestic shipping service, other than or in addition to Local Pickup.

  .Item.StartPrice	AmountType (double)	Conditionally	The original price of the item at listing or re-listing time. If this value changes when the item is revised, the new value becomes the original price.

For auction listings: Competitive bidding starts at this value. Once at least one bid has been placed, StartPrice remains the same but CurrentPrice is incremented to the amount of each succeeding bid. If ReservePrice is also specified, the value of StartPrice must be lower than the value of ReservePrice.

For input on fixed-price listings (FixedPriceItem): This is the constant price at which a buyer may purchase the item.

GetMyeBaySelling does not return Item.StartPrice for fixed price items—it returns Item.SellingStatus.CurrentPrice.

For AddFixedPriceItem and VerifyAddFixedPriceItem: Required when no variations are specified. If variations are specified, use Variation.StartPrice for each variation instead.

For Revise calls: If the StartPrice value for a fixed-price item is changed with a Revise call, the MinimumBestOfferPrice and BestOfferAutoAcceptPrice fields in the ListingDetails container will be dropped (if set), basically turning off the Best Offer Auto Accept and/or Auto Decline features. If the seller wanted to reintroduce either of these Best Offer threshold values in the listing again, an additional Revise call would have to be made, passing in the desired threshold values.

Note: For the US site, new eBay sellers are subject to Seller Limits, which limit the quantity of items that may be listed and/or the total cumulative value of these listings. While subject to these selling limits, an eBay seller can use the GetMyeBaySelling call to retrieve both the remaining number of listings they can create and the remaining cumulative value of these listings. These values are shown in the Summary.QuantityLimitRemaining and Summary.AmountLimitRemaining fields in the GetMyeBaySelling response. If a call to add an item or revise an item would result in the exceeding of these limits, the add item or revise item call will fail. These fields will only be returned if the seller is subject to seller limits.

  .Item.Variations	VariationsType	Conditionally	
Variations are similar (but not identical) items in a multiple-variation, fixed-price listing. For example, a T-shirt listing could contain multiple items of the same brand that vary by color and size (like "Blue, Large" and "Black, Medium"). Each variation specifies a combination of one of these colors and sizes. Each variation can have a different quantity and price. You can buy multiple items from one variation at the same time. (That is, one order line item can contain multiple items from a single variation.)

If you list in two categories, both categories must support listing with variations. See VariationsEnabled in GetCategoryFeatures to determine applicable categories.

For ReviseFixedPriceItem and RelistFixedPriceItem: Once a listing has been submitted with variations, you can't delete all the variations when you revise or relist the listing (because it would be considered a different listing). You also can't add or change variation specifics (because they are unique identifiers). However, you can delete or replace individual variations as needed to match your current inventory. If a variation has no purchases, use the Variation.Delete field to delete the variation. If it has inventory, set the Quantity to 0.

As a best practice, if you want to revise multiple variations in the same listing at the same time (i.e., within a very short period), use a single ReviseFixedPriceItem request and include all the variation revisions in the same request. If your application design requires you to revise each variation individually, then avoid using multiple parallel threads. Instead, use a serial, synchronous process. That is, wait until each revision has been processed by eBay before submitting the next revision request for another variation in the same listing.

For GetItem and related calls Only returned when a listing has variations.

For GetSellerList: Only returned when a listing has variations, IncludeVariations was set to true in the request, the DetailLevel was set to ReturnAll, and an applicable pagination value and time range were specified.

For GetItemTransactions Only returned in Item when a listing has variations and IncludeVariations was set to true in the request. (Also see Variation returned in Transaction for information about which variation was actually purchased.)

For GetSellerEvents, GetMyeBayBuying, and GetMyeBaySelling: Only returned when a listing has variations and HideVariations was set to false or not specified in the request.
Note: This container will stop being returned in GetItemTransactions on January 31, 2024.

  .Item.Variations.Variation	VariationType	Conditionally,
repeatable: [0..*]	
Contains data that distinguishes one item variation from another. For example, if an item varies by color and size, each Variation node specifies a combination of one of those colors and sizes.

When listing or relisting an item, you are allowed to create a listing with only one item variation, and you might have a plan to add more item variations to the listing in the future. However, if you don't plan to add other item variations in the future, we recommend that you avoid listing with only one variation, so that you avoid confusing buyers.

If you specify multiple Variation containers in an add/revise/relist/verify add call to define multiple item variations, the Variation containers must be contiguous or an error will occur. This means that you would not want to input a Pictures or a VariationSpecificsSet container in between Variation containers in an API call.

When you modify an item variation with a ReviseFixedPriceItem call, the best practice is to include all applicable fields under the Variation container, even if some of the values/settings are not being modified. The StartPrice and VariationSpecifics must be included when modifying an existing item variation, even if these values are not being changed. If a SKU value is defined for the item variation, it is strongly recommended that you include the SKU field, regardless of whether the SKU value is changing or not. If the SKU field is not included, any existing SKU value will be removed from the item variation. It is also strongly recommended that you include the Quantity field and input an accurate value, because if the Quantity field is omitted in the API call, the quantity for the item variation is set to 0.
Note: The Item.Variations container and its child fields will stop being returned in GetItemTransactions on January 31, 2024.

  .Item.Variations.Variation
  .VariationSpecifics	NameValueListArrayType	Conditionally,
repeatable: [2..5]	
A list of name/value pairs that uniquely identify the variation within the listing. All variations must specify the same set of Item Specific names, but each variation must provide a unique combination of values for those Item Specific names. For example, if the items vary by color and size, then every variation must specify 'Color' and 'Size' as Item Specific names, but no two variations can specify the same combination of 'Color' and 'Size' values.

When you revise a listing that includes variations, you can change names of Variationpecifics by using the Variations.ModifyNameList container. You can also add, delete, or replace individual variations as needed to match your current inventory. Use the Variation.Delete field to delete a variation that has no sales (order line items). If the variation has sales, then set the Quantity to 0.

For GetSellerEvents To keep the GetSellerEvents response smaller, Variationpecifics are not returned if the variation has a SKU. If the variation has no SKU, then Variationpecifics are returned instead. Optionally, you can pass IncludeVariationSpecifics as true in the request to force Variationpecifics to be returned, even when the SKU is returned.

For the AddFixedPriceItem family of calls: The same NameValueList schema is used for the ItemSpecifics node, the VariationSpecifics node, and the VariationSpecifcsSet node.

If the listing has variations, any name that you use in the VariationSpecifics and VariationSpecificsSet nodes can't be used in the ItemSpecifics node.
When you list with Item Variations:
Specify shared Item Specifics (e.g., Brand) in the ItemSpecifics node.
Specify up to five VariationSpecifics in each Variation node.
Specify all applicable names with all their supported values in the VariationSpecificSet node.
See the Variation sample in the AddFixedPriceItem call reference for examples.

For PlaceOffer: Required if the item being purchased includes Item Variations.

For AddToWatchList and RemoveFromWatchList: The ItemID value of the multiple-variation listing and the name-value pair to identify each variation in the listing are required.

Note: As of August 30, 2018, California will require sellers to display a Proposition 65 warning on online retail sites if products contain chemicals and/or substances that may impact the health of California buyers. This requirement is applicable to most eBay US categories, including eBay Motors, Motors Parts & Accessories, and catalog-enabled categories. The warning message can be customized by the seller, but should contain the following basic information:
The name of at least one listed chemical that prompted the warning
Text stating that the product 'can expose you to' the chemical(s) in the product
The URL for OEHHA's new Proposition 65 warnings website, which is www.P65Warnings.ca.gov
Unlike standard item specifics that allow a maximum of 65 characters in the Value field, the matching value for the 'California Prop 65 Warning' item specific allows up to 800 characters of text. When a seller passes in this item specific, eBay will automatically insert a warning symbol icon for the listing.

  .NameValueList.Name	string	Conditionally	Depending on the call and context, this value is either a name of an Item/Variation Specific, or a Parts Compatibility name.

For the AddItem and AddFixedPriceItem families of calls: In the Item.ItemSpecifics context, the value in this field will either be the name of a required/recommended/optional item specific name for the category, or it may be a seller's customized item specific name.

For the AddFixedPriceItem family of calls: In the Compatibility.NameValueList context, this value is a motor vehicle aspect such as Year, Make, and Model. A Compatibility.NameValueList container is applicable for motor vehicle parts and accessories listings.

For PlaceOffer: Required if the line item being purchased is an item variation within a multiple-variation listing.

Note: For required and recommended item specifics that are returned in the getItemAspectsForCategory method of the Taxonomy API, the seller should pass in the name of these item specifics just as they are shown in the getItemAspectsForCategory response. Similarly, for catalog-enabled categories, the seller should pass in the name of instance aspects just as they are shown in the getItemAspectsForCategory response. Instance aspects are additional details unique to a specific item or listing that a seller can include along with the product aspects that are already defined in the eBay catalog product associated with the listing. Instance aspects common to many catalog-enabled categories include 'Bundle Description' and 'Modification Description'. eBay US sellers who ship to California are required to pass in a 'California Prop 65 Warning' item specific if the item in the listing contains one or more chemicals known to be harmful to human health. This item specific is passed at the listing level for both single-variation and multiple-variation listings. The 'California Prop 65 Warning' is considered an instance specific because it will be retained on the listing even when the seller lists using an eBay catalog product. The 'California Prop 65 Warning' may be applicable in most eBay US categories, including eBay Motors, Motors Parts & Accessories, and catalog-enabled categories.
Note: If Brand and MPN (Manufacturer Part Number) are being used to identify product variations in a multiple-variation listing, the Brand must be specified at the item level (ItemSpecifics container) and the MPN for each product variation must be specified at the variation level (VariationSpecifics container). The Brand name must be the same for all variations within a single listing.

For the AddItem family of calls: Multiple values can only be specified for an Item Specific if the itemToAspectCardinality field of the getItemAspectsForCategory method shows a value of MULTI. If an item specific only supports a single value, only the first item specific value specified in the request will be used.

For the Compatibility.NameValueList context, this is the corresponding value of a motor vehicle aspect such as Year, Make, and Model. A Compatibility.NameValueList container is applicable for motor vehicle parts and accessories listings.

For PlaceOffer: Required if the line item being purchased is an item variation within a multiple-variation listing.

Note: The standard maximum length for the value of an item specific is 65, but the maximum allowed length increases for instance aspects such as 'Bundle Description' and 'Modification Description'. For item specifics with max lengths greater than 65, the actual max length will be returned in a corresponding aspectMaxLength field. The maximum allowed length for the new 'California Prop 65 Warning' item specific is 800 characters. For more information about the 'California Prop 65 Warning' item specific, see the ItemSpecifics.NameValueList field description.

  .TransactionID	string	Conditionally	Unique identifier for an eBay sales transaction. This identifier is created once there is a commitment from a buyer to purchase an item, or if/when the buyer actually purchases the line item through a 'Buy it Now' option. An ItemID/TransactionID pair can be used and referenced during an order checkout flow to identify a line item.

The TransactionID value for auction listings is always 0 since there can be only one winning bidder/one sale for an auction listing.

Note: Historically, TransactionID values have been '0' for auction listings, and some developers may have built logic around this. However, non-zero TransactionID values for auction listings started being used for some eBay marketplaces beginning in July 2024, and all eBay marketplaces are expected to start using non-zero TransactionID values for auction listings in the near future. If necessary, developers should update code to handle non-zero transaction IDs for auction transactions.

For GetOrders and GetItemTransactions only: If using Trading WSDL Version 1019 or above, this field will only be returned to the buyer and seller, and no longer returned at all to third parties. If using a Trading WSDL older than Version 1019, transaction ID is only returned to the buyer and seller, and a dummy value of 10000000000000 will be returned to all third parties.

Note: Effective September 26, 2025, select developers will no longer receive username data for U.S. users through this field. Instead, an immutable user ID will be returned in its place. For more information, please refer to Data Handling Compliance.

Since a bidder's user info is anonymous, this tag contains the actual value of an ID only for that bidder, and for the seller of an item that the user is bidding on. For other users, the actual value is replaced by an anonymous value, according to these rules:

When bidding on items, UserID is replaced with the value "a****b" where a and b are random characters from the UserID. For example, if the UserID = IBidALot, it might be displayed as, "I****A".

Important: In this format, the anonymous bidder ID can change for each auction.
For GetMyeBayBuying only, when bidding on items: UserID is replaced with the value "a****b" where a and b are random characters from the UserID.

When bidding on items listed on the Philippines site: UserID is replaced with the value "Bidder X" where X is a number indicating the order of that user's first bid. For example, if the user was the third bidder, UserID = Bidder 3. Note that in this Philippines site format, the anonymous bidder ID stays the same for a given auction, but is different for different auctions. For example, a bidder who is the third and then the seventh bidder in an auction will be listed for both bids as "Bidder 3". However, if that same bidder is the first bidder on a different auction, the bidder will be listed for that auction as "Bidder 1", not "Bidder 3".

For GetMyeBayBuying only, when bidding on items listed on the UK and AU sites: UserID is replaced with the string "High Bidder".

A fulfillment business policy can be set up and/or modified in My eBay, or via the Account API. A fulfillment business policy is associated to a listing through the Item.SellerProfiles.SellerShippingProfile container.

If you do not use a fulfillment business policy, many of the fields under this ShippingDetails container become required in your request.
Note: For ReviseItem and ReviseFixedPriceItem calls: If you are updating any field under the ShippingDetails container, you must include all containers and fields set under this container even if their values are not changing. If you do not do this, some fields may be removed from the listing. To find out the values included in the current listing, call GetItem and look through the ShippingDetails container in the response. For additional information, see Revise shipping details.
New users who list their first items in selected categories on the US site must specify at least one domestic shipping service. This applies to a category if GetCategoryFeatures returns true for Category.ShippingTermsRequired.

For multi-quantity, fixed-price listings, a seller can revise all shipping details of the listing (except for sales tax and for shipping type of Freight) for all unsold items. This applies to both domestic and international shipping. Checkout is not affected for those who bought items prior to the seller's shipping changes—the shipping details that were in effect at the time of purchase are used for that buyer at the time of checkout.

Shipping details are not applicable to any classified ad listings, as shipping/delivery/pickup is handled by the buyer and seller off of the eBay platform.

Note: To create a listing that is 'Local Pickup only' (buyer picks up, with no shipping/delivery available), the user does the following two things:
Either omit the entire ShippingDetails container, or pass in an empty ShippingDetails container - <ShippingDetails/>
Pass in one ShipToLocations field, with its value set to None - <ShipToLocations>None</ShipToLocations>

For GetMyeBayBuying, GetMyeBaySelling: ShippingDetails is not returned.

If you specify multiple InternationalShippingServiceOption nodes, the repeating nodes must be contiguous. That is, you cannot insert other nodes between InternationalShippingServiceOption nodes.

All specified domestic and international shipping services must be the same shipping type (for example, Flat versus Calculated).

A seller can offer up to four domestic shipping services and up to five international shipping services. However, if the seller is opted in to the Global Shipping Program or eBay International Shipping, only four other international shipping services may be offered (regardless of whether or not Global Shipping or eBay International Shipping is offered for the listing).

If you specify ShippingDetails when you revise or relist an item but you omit InternationalShippingServiceOption, eBay will drop the international shipping services (except the Global Shipping Program or eBay International Shipping) from the listing. This may also have unintended side effects, as other fields that depend on this data may be dropped as well. To retain the shipping services and dependent fields when you modify other shipping details, it may be simplest to specify all ShippingDetails that you still want to include in the listing.

A separate ShippingServiceOptions container is needed for each domestic shipping service option that is available to ship the item. Unless a fulfillment business policy is being used, generally at least one ShippingServiceOptions container will be required.

If you specify multiple ShippingServiceOptions nodes, the repeating nodes must be contiguous. For example, you can insert InternationalShippingServiceOption nodes after a list of repeating ShippingServiceOptions nodes, but not between them:

Note: If the seller has set the shipping cost model to 'Flat' or 'Calculated' (ShippingDetails.ShippingType field), at least one actual shipping service option must be specified through a ShippingServiceOptions container. In the past, eBay allowed users to set the shipping cost model to 'Flat' or 'Calculated', and then just pass in one ShippingServiceOptions container with the ShippingServiceOptions.ShipppingService value set to a 'Local Pickup' option. Now, sellers must pass in at least one actual domestic shipping service option in addition to any 'Local Pickup' option, or the listing will be blocked with the following error: 17510 - You must specify at least one domestic shipping service, other than or in addition to Local Pickup.

For GetItemShipping, results are filtered: if any service is not available in the buyer's region, it is removed. If no services remain after this filtering, a warning is returned.

In an Add/Revise/Relist call, free shipping can only be offered for the first specified shipping service (so, the corresponding ShippingServicePriority value should be 1 or included first in the call request). If 'free shipping' is for any other shipping service, this field is ignored.

For 'Get' calls, including GetItem, this field is only returned if 1.
Note: If a seller is specifying a shipping service option as 'free shipping', in addition to this FreeShipping boolean field, the seller will also need to include the corresponding ShippingServiceCost field and set its value to 0.0, as eBay will not do this automatically.
Note: If the condition is certified refurbished (ConditionID set to 2000, 'Certified - Refurbished'), you must offer a free shipping option. Set FreeShipping as true (or 1) along with the ShippingServiceCost as 0.0 for the first domestic shipping service.

The LocalPickup flag can also be used with other fields to indicate if there is no fee for local pickup.

For example, if the LocalPickup flag is used with the ShippingServiceOptions and ShippingServiceCost fields, the seller can indicate that local pickup is an available option and that no is fee charged. This is the equivalent of free shipping.

This field is required to identify each domestic shipping service option that is specified with a ShippingServiceOptions container.

For a list of valid ShippingService values, call GeteBayDetails with DetailName set to ShippingServiceDetails. The ShippingServiceDetails.ValidForSellingFlow flag must also be present. Otherwise, that particular shipping service option is no longer valid and cannot be offered to buyers through a listing.

To view the full list of domestic shipping service options in the response, look for the ShippingServiceDetails.ShippingService fields. Domestic shipping service options will not have a InternationalService = true field, as this indicates that the ShippingService value is an International shipping service option.

Note: The eBay standard envelope (eSE) is a domestic envelope service with tracking through eBay. This service applies to specific sub-categories of Trading Cards, and to coins & paper money, postcards, stamps, patches, and similar eligible categories, and is only available on the US marketplace.

The listing site affects the business logic and validation rules that are applied to the request, which in turn affect the values that are returned in the response, as well as values that appear on the eBay site. For example, the listing site can affect the validation of Category in listing requests, international business seller requirements, the values of converted (localized) prices in responses, the item-related time stamps that are displayed on the eBay site, the visibility of the item in some types of searches (e.g., GetCategoryListings), and other information. In some cases, the rules are determined by a combination of the site, the user's registration address, and other information. You cannot change the site when you revise a listing.

For auction listings: Competitive bidding starts at this value. Once at least one bid has been placed, StartPrice remains the same but CurrentPrice is incremented to the amount of each succeeding bid. If ReservePrice is also specified, the value of StartPrice must be lower than the value of ReservePrice.

For input on fixed-price listings (FixedPriceItem): This is the constant price at which a buyer may purchase the item.

GetMyeBaySelling does not return Item.StartPrice for fixed price items—it returns Item.SellingStatus.CurrentPrice.

For AddFixedPriceItem and VerifyAddFixedPriceItem: Required when no variations are specified. If variations are specified, use Variation.StartPrice for each variation instead.

For Revise calls: If the StartPrice value for a fixed-price item is changed with a Revise call, the MinimumBestOfferPrice and BestOfferAutoAcceptPrice fields in the ListingDetails container will be dropped (if set), basically turning off the Best Offer Auto Accept and/or Auto Decline features. If the seller wanted to reintroduce either of these Best Offer threshold values in the listing again, an additional Revise call would have to be made, passing in the desired threshold values.

Note: For the US site, new eBay sellers are subject to Seller Limits, which limit the quantity of items that may be listed and/or the total cumulative value of these listings. While subject to these selling limits, an eBay seller can use the GetMyeBaySelling call to retrieve both the remaining number of listings they can create and the remaining cumulative value of these listings. These values are shown in the Summary.QuantityLimitRemaining and Summary.AmountLimitRemaining fields in the GetMyeBaySelling response. If a call to add an item or revise an item would result in the exceeding of these limits, the add item or revise item call will fail. These fields will only be returned if the seller is subject to seller limits.

  .Item.Variations	VariationsType	Conditionally	
Variations are similar (but not identical) items in a multiple-variation, fixed-price listing. For example, a T-shirt listing could contain multiple items of the same brand that vary by color and size (like "Blue, Large" and "Black, Medium"). Each variation specifies a combination of one of these colors and sizes. Each variation can have a different quantity and price. You can buy multiple items from one variation at the same time. (That is, one order line item can contain multiple items from a single variation.)

If you list in two categories, both categories must support listing with variations. See VariationsEnabled in GetCategoryFeatures to determine applicable categories.

For ReviseFixedPriceItem and RelistFixedPriceItem: Once a listing has been submitted with variations, you can't delete all the variations when you revise or relist the listing (because it would be considered a different listing). You also can't add or change variation specifics (because they are unique identifiers). However, you can delete or replace individual variations as needed to match your current inventory. If a variation has no purchases, use the Variation.Delete field to delete the variation. If it has inventory, set the Quantity to 0.

As a best practice, if you want to revise multiple variations in the same listing at the same time (i.e., within a very short period), use a single ReviseFixedPriceItem request and include all the variation revisions in the same request. If your application design requires you to revise each variation individually, then avoid using multiple parallel threads. Instead, use a serial, synchronous process. That is, wait until each revision has been processed by eBay before submitting the next revision request for another variation in the same listing.

For GetItem and related calls Only returned when a listing has variations.

For GetSellerList: Only returned when a listing has variations, IncludeVariations was set to true in the request, the DetailLevel was set to ReturnAll, and an applicable pagination value and time range were specified.

For GetItemTransactions Only returned in Item when a listing has variations and IncludeVariations was set to true in the request. (Also see Variation returned in Transaction for information about which variation was actually purchased.)

For GetSellerEvents, GetMyeBayBuying, and GetMyeBaySelling: Only returned when a listing has variations and HideVariations was set to false or not specified in the request.

  .Item.Variations.Variation	VariationType	Conditionally,
repeatable: [0..*]	
Contains data that distinguishes one item variation from another. For example, if an item varies by color and size, each Variation node specifies a combination of one of those colors and sizes.

When listing or relisting an item, you are allowed to create a listing with only one item variation, and you might have a plan to add more item variations to the listing in the future. However, if you don't plan to add other item variations in the future, we recommend that you avoid listing with only one variation, so that you avoid confusing buyers.

If you specify multiple Variation containers in an add/revise/relist/verify add call to define multiple item variations, the Variation containers must be contiguous or an error will occur. This means that you would not want to input a Pictures or a VariationSpecificsSet container in between Variation containers in an API call.

When you modify an item variation with a ReviseFixedPriceItem call, the best practice is to include all applicable fields under the Variation container, even if some of the values/settings are not being modified. The StartPrice and VariationSpecifics must be included when modifying an existing item variation, even if these values are not being changed. If a SKU value is defined for the item variation, it is strongly recommended that you include the SKU field, regardless of whether the SKU value is changing or not. If the SKU field is not included, any existing SKU value will be removed from the item variation. It is also strongly recommended that you include the Quantity field and input an accurate value, because if the Quantity field is omitted in the API call, the quantity for the item variation is set to 0.
Note: The Item.Variations container and its child fields will stop being returned in GetItemTransactions on January 31, 2024.

A list of name/value pairs that uniquely identify the variation within the listing. All variations must specify the same set of Item Specific names, but each variation must provide a unique combination of values for those Item Specific names. For example, if the items vary by color and size, then every variation must specify 'Color' and 'Size' as Item Specific names, but no two variations can specify the same combination of 'Color' and 'Size' values.

When you revise a listing that includes variations, you can change names of Variationpecifics by using the Variations.ModifyNameList container. You can also add, delete, or replace individual variations as needed to match your current inventory. Use the Variation.Delete field to delete a variation that has no sales (order line items). If the variation has sales, then set the Quantity to 0.

For GetSellerEvents To keep the GetSellerEvents response smaller, Variationpecifics are not returned if the variation has a SKU. If the variation has no SKU, then Variationpecifics are returned instead. Optionally, you can pass IncludeVariationSpecifics as true in the request to force Variationpecifics to be returned, even when the SKU is returned.

Note: As of August 30, 2018, California will require sellers to display a Proposition 65 warning on online retail sites if products contain chemicals and/or substances that may impact the health of California buyers. This requirement is applicable to most eBay US categories, including eBay Motors, Motors Parts & Accessories, and catalog-enabled categories. The warning message can be customized by the seller, but should contain the following basic information:
The name of at least one listed chemical that prompted the warning
Text stating that the product 'can expose you to' the chemical(s) in the product
The URL for OEHHA's new Proposition 65 warnings website, which is www.P65Warnings.ca.gov
Unlike standard item specifics that allow a maximum of 65 characters in the Value field, the matching value for the 'California Prop 65 Warning' item specific allows up to 800 characters of text. When a seller passes in this item specific, eBay will automatically insert a warning symbol icon for the listing.

For the AddFixedPriceItem family of calls: In the Compatibility.NameValueList context, this value is a motor vehicle aspect such as Year, Make, and Model. A Compatibility.NameValueList container is applicable for motor vehicle parts and accessories listings.

For PlaceOffer: Required if the line item being purchased is an item variation within a multiple-variation listing.

Note: For required and recommended item specifics that are returned in the getItemAspectsForCategory method of the Taxonomy API, the seller should pass in the name of these item specifics just as they are shown in the getItemAspectsForCategory response. Similarly, for catalog-enabled categories, the seller should pass in the name of instance aspects just as they are shown in the getItemAspectsForCategory response. Instance aspects are additional details unique to a specific item or listing that a seller can include along with the product aspects that are already defined in the eBay catalog product associated with the listing. Instance aspects common to many catalog-enabled categories include 'Bundle Description' and 'Modification Description'. eBay US sellers who ship to California are required to pass in a 'California Prop 65 Warning' item specific if the item in the listing contains one or more chemicals known to be harmful to human health. This item specific is passed at the listing level for both single-variation and multiple-variation listings. The 'California Prop 65 Warning' is considered an instance specific because it will be retained on the listing even when the seller lists using an eBay catalog product. The 'California Prop 65 Warning' may be applicable in most eBay US categories, including eBay Motors, Motors Parts & Accessories, and catalog-enabled categories.
Note: If Brand and MPN (Manufacturer Part Number) are being used to identify product variations in a multiple-variation listing, the Brand must be specified at the item level (ItemSpecifics container) and the MPN for each product variation must be specified at the variation level (VariationSpecifics container). The Brand name must be the same for all variations within a single listing.

This identifier is created once there is a commitment from a buyer to purchase an item, or if/when the buyer actually purchases the line item through a 'Buy it Now' option. An ItemID/TransactionID pair can be used and referenced during an order checkout flow to identify a line item.

The TransactionID value for auction listings is always 0 since there can be only one winning bidder/one sale for an auction listing.

Note: Historically, TransactionID values have been '0' for auction listings, and some developers may have built logic around this. However, non-zero TransactionID values for auction listings started being used for some eBay marketplaces beginning in July 2024, and all eBay marketplaces are expected to start using non-zero TransactionID values for auction listings in the near future. If necessary, developers should update code to handle non-zero transaction IDs for auction transactions.

DetailLevel: ReturnAll. Also returned if DetailLevel is not provided on input.
LostList.ItemArray.Item.Seller
  .FeedbackScore	int	Conditionally	The aggregate feedback score for a user. A user's feedback score is the net positive feedback minus the net negative feedback left for the user. Feedback scores are a quantitative expression of the desirability of dealing with a user as a buyer or a seller in either side of an order.

Each order line item can result in one feedback entry for a given user (the buyer can leave feedback for the seller, and the seller can leave feedback for the buyer.). That one feedback can be positive, negative, or neutral. The aggregated feedback counts for a particular user represent that user's overall feedback score (referred to as a "feedback rating" on the eBay site).

If the user has chosen to make their feedback private and that user is not the user identified in the request's authentication token, FeedbackScore is not returned and FeedbackPrivate is returned with a value of true.

In GetMyeBayBuying and GetMyeBaySelling, feedback information (FeedbackScore and FeedbackRatingStar) is returned in BidList.ItemArray.Item.Seller. For GetMyeBayBuying, the feedback score of each seller with an item having received a bid from the buyer is returned. For GetMyeBaySelling, the feedback score of the seller is returned.

GetMyeBayBuying and GetMyeBaySelling also return feedback information (FeedbackScore and FeedbackRatingStar) in BidList.ItemArray.Item.SellingStatus.HighBidder. GetMyeBayBuying returns feedback information on the high bidder of each item the buyer is bidding on. GetMyeBaySelling returns feedback information on the high bidder of each item the seller is selling.

Since a bidder's user info is anonymous, the real feedback score will be returned only to that bidder, and to the seller of an item that the user is bidding on. For all other users, the value -99 is returned.

For GetOrders and GetItemTransactions only: If using Trading WSDL Version 1019 or above, this field will only be returned to the buyer or seller, and no longer returned at all to third parties. If using a Trading WSDL older than Version 1019, the accurate Feedback Score for the user is returned to the buyer or seller, but a dummy value of 0 will be returned to all third parties.

LostList.ItemArray.Item.Seller
  .UserID	UserIDType (string)	Conditionally	Unique eBay user ID for the user.

Note: Effective September 26, 2025, select developers will no longer receive username data for U.S. users through this field. Instead, an immutable user ID will be returned in its place. For more information, please refer to Data Handling Compliance.

Since a bidder's user info is anonymous, this tag contains the actual value of an ID only for that bidder, and for the seller of an item that the user is bidding on. For other users, the actual value is replaced by an anonymous value, according to these rules:

When bidding on items, UserID is replaced with the value "a****b" where a and b are random characters from the UserID. For example, if the UserID = IBidALot, it might be displayed as, "I****A".

Important: In this format, the anonymous bidder ID can change for each auction.
For GetMyeBayBuying only, when bidding on items: UserID is replaced with the value "a****b" where a and b are random characters from the UserID.

When bidding on items listed on the Philippines site: UserID is replaced with the value "Bidder X" where X is a number indicating the order of that user's first bid. For example, if the user was the third bidder, UserID = Bidder 3. Note that in this Philippines site format, the anonymous bidder ID stays the same for a given auction, but is different for different auctions. For example, a bidder who is the third and then the seventh bidder in an auction will be listed for both bids as "Bidder 3". However, if that same bidder is the first bidder on a different auction, the bidder will be listed for that auction as "Bidder 1", not "Bidder 3".

For GetMyeBayBuying only, when bidding on items listed on the UK and AU sites: UserID is replaced with the string "High Bidder".

For ended, single-item, fixed-price listings, this field is a container for the user ID of the purchaser. This field isn't returned for auctions with no bids, or for active fixed-price listings.

In the case of PlaceOffer, for auction listings, this field is a container for the high bidder's user ID.

LostList.ItemArray.Item.Site	SiteCodeType	Conditionally	The name of the eBay listing site. The listing site affects the business logic and validation rules that are applied to the request, which in turn affect the values that are returned in the response, as well as values that appear on the eBay site. For example, the listing site can affect the validation of Category in listing requests, international business seller requirements, the values of converted (localized) prices in responses, the item-related time stamps that are displayed on the eBay site, the visibility of the item in some types of searches (e.g., GetCategoryListings), and other information. In some cases, the rules are determined by a combination of the site, the user's registration address, and other information. You cannot change the site when you revise a listing.

When you specify Item.Site in AddItem or AddFixedPriceItem, it must be consistent with the numeric site ID that you specify in the request URL (for the SOAP API) or the X-EBAY-API-SITEID header (for the XML API).

LostList.ItemArray.Item
  .StartPrice	AmountType (double)	Conditionally	The original price of the item at listing or re-listing time. If this value changes when the item is revised, the new value becomes the original price.

For auction listings: Competitive bidding starts at this value. Once at least one bid has been placed, StartPrice remains the same but CurrentPrice is incremented to the amount of each succeeding bid. If ReservePrice is also specified, the value of StartPrice must be lower than the value of ReservePrice.

For input on fixed-price listings (FixedPriceItem): This is the constant price at which a buyer may purchase the item.

GetMyeBaySelling does not return Item.StartPrice for fixed price items—it returns Item.SellingStatus.CurrentPrice.

For AddFixedPriceItem and VerifyAddFixedPriceItem: Required when no variations are specified. If variations are specified, use Variation.StartPrice for each variation instead.

For Revise calls: If the StartPrice value for a fixed-price item is changed with a Revise call, the MinimumBestOfferPrice and BestOfferAutoAcceptPrice fields in the ListingDetails container will be dropped (if set), basically turning off the Best Offer Auto Accept and/or Auto Decline features. If the seller wanted to reintroduce either of these Best Offer threshold values in the listing again, an additional Revise call would have to be made, passing in the desired threshold values.

Note: For the US site, new eBay sellers are subject to Seller Limits, which limit the quantity of items that may be listed and/or the total cumulative value of these listings. While subject to these selling limits, an eBay seller can use the GetMyeBaySelling call to retrieve both the remaining number of listings they can create and the remaining cumulative value of these listings. These values are shown in the Summary.QuantityLimitRemaining and Summary.AmountLimitRemaining fields in the GetMyeBaySelling response. If a call to add an item or revise an item would result in the exceeding of these limits, the add item or revise item call will fail. These fields will only be returned if the seller is subject to seller limits.

LostList.ItemArray.Item
  .Variations	VariationsType	Conditionally	
Variations are similar (but not identical) items in a multiple-variation, fixed-price listing. For example, a T-shirt listing could contain multiple items of the same brand that vary by color and size (like "Blue, Large" and "Black, Medium"). Each variation specifies a combination of one of these colors and sizes. Each variation can have a different quantity and price. You can buy multiple items from one variation at the same time. (That is, one order line item can contain multiple items from a single variation.)

If you list in two categories, both categories must support listing with variations. See VariationsEnabled in GetCategoryFeatures to determine applicable categories.

For ReviseFixedPriceItem and RelistFixedPriceItem: Once a listing has been submitted with variations, you can't delete all the variations when you revise or relist the listing (because it would be considered a different listing). You also can't add or change variation specifics (because they are unique identifiers). However, you can delete or replace individual variations as needed to match your current inventory. If a variation has no purchases, use the Variation.Delete field to delete the variation. If it has inventory, set the Quantity to 0.

As a best practice, if you want to revise multiple variations in the same listing at the same time (i.e., within a very short period), use a single ReviseFixedPriceItem request and include all the variation revisions in the same request. If your application design requires you to revise each variation individually, then avoid using multiple parallel threads. Instead, use a serial, synchronous process. That is, wait until each revision has been processed by eBay before submitting the next revision request for another variation in the same listing.

For GetItem and related calls Only returned when a listing has variations.

For GetSellerList: Only returned when a listing has variations, IncludeVariations was set to true in the request, the DetailLevel was set to ReturnAll, and an applicable pagination value and time range were specified.

For GetItemTransactions Only returned in Item when a listing has variations and IncludeVariations was set to true in the request. (Also see Variation returned in Transaction for information about which variation was actually purchased.)

For GetSellerEvents, GetMyeBayBuying, and GetMyeBaySelling: Only returned when a listing has variations and HideVariations was set to false or not specified in the request.
Note: This container will stop being returned in GetItemTransactions on January 31, 2024.


DetailLevel: ReturnAll. Also returned if DetailLevel is not provided on input.
See Multiple-variation listings.

LostList.ItemArray.Item
  .Variations.Variation	VariationType	Conditionally,
repeatable: [0..*]	
Contains data that distinguishes one item variation from another. For example, if an item varies by color and size, each Variation node specifies a combination of one of those colors and sizes.

When listing or relisting an item, you are allowed to create a listing with only one item variation, and you might have a plan to add more item variations to the listing in the future. However, if you don't plan to add other item variations in the future, we recommend that you avoid listing with only one variation, so that you avoid confusing buyers.

If you specify multiple Variation containers in an add/revise/relist/verify add call to define multiple item variations, the Variation containers must be contiguous or an error will occur. This means that you would not want to input a Pictures or a VariationSpecificsSet container in between Variation containers in an API call.

When you modify an item variation with a ReviseFixedPriceItem call, the best practice is to include all applicable fields under the Variation container, even if some of the values/settings are not being modified. The StartPrice and VariationSpecifics must be included when modifying an existing item variation, even if these values are not being changed. If a SKU value is defined for the item variation, it is strongly recommended that you include the SKU field, regardless of whether the SKU value is changing or not. If the SKU field is not included, any existing SKU value will be removed from the item variation. It is also strongly recommended that you include the Quantity field and input an accurate value, because if the Quantity field is omitted in the API call, the quantity for the item variation is set to 0.
Note: The Item.Variations container and its child fields will stop being returned in GetItemTransactions on January 31, 2024.


DetailLevel: ReturnAll. Also returned if DetailLevel is not provided on input.
See Multiple-variation listings.

LostList.ItemArray.Item
  .Variations.Variation
  .VariationSpecifics	NameValueListArrayType	Conditionally,
repeatable: [2..5]	
A list of name/value pairs that uniquely identify the variation within the listing. All variations must specify the same set of Item Specific names, but each variation must provide a unique combination of values for those Item Specific names. For example, if the items vary by color and size, then every variation must specify 'Color' and 'Size' as Item Specific names, but no two variations can specify the same combination of 'Color' and 'Size' values.

When you revise a listing that includes variations, you can change names of Variationpecifics by using the Variations.ModifyNameList container. You can also add, delete, or replace individual variations as needed to match your current inventory. Use the Variation.Delete field to delete a variation that has no sales (order line items). If the variation has sales, then set the Quantity to 0.

For GetSellerEvents To keep the GetSellerEvents response smaller, Variationpecifics are not returned if the variation has a SKU. If the variation has no SKU, then Variationpecifics are returned instead. Optionally, you can pass IncludeVariationSpecifics as true in the request to force Variationpecifics to be returned, even when the SKU is returned.
Note: The Item.Variations container and its child fields will stop being returned in GetItemTransactions on January 31, 2024.

  .Variations.Variation
  .VariationSpecifics
  .NameValueList	NameValueListType	Conditionally,
repeatable: [0..*]	For the AddItem family of calls: Contains the name and value(s) for an Item Specific. Only required when the ItemSpecifics container is specified.
For the AddFixedPriceItem family of calls: The same NameValueList schema is used for the ItemSpecifics node, the VariationSpecifics node, and the VariationSpecifcsSet node.

If the listing has variations, any name that you use in the VariationSpecifics and VariationSpecificsSet nodes can't be used in the ItemSpecifics node.
When you list with Item Variations:
Specify shared Item Specifics (e.g., Brand) in the ItemSpecifics node.
Specify up to five VariationSpecifics in each Variation node.
Specify all applicable names with all their supported values in the VariationSpecificSet node.
See the Variation sample in the AddFixedPriceItem call reference for examples.

For PlaceOffer: Required if the item being purchased includes Item Variations.

For AddToWatchList and RemoveFromWatchList: The ItemID value of the multiple-variation listing and the name-value pair to identify each variation in the listing are required.

Note: As of August 30, 2018, California will require sellers to display a Proposition 65 warning on online retail sites if products contain chemicals and/or substances that may impact the health of California buyers. This requirement is applicable to most eBay US categories, including eBay Motors, Motors Parts & Accessories, and catalog-enabled categories. The warning message can be customized by the seller, but should contain the following basic information:
The name of at least one listed chemical that prompted the warning
Text stating that the product 'can expose you to' the chemical(s) in the product
The URL for OEHHA's new Proposition 65 warnings website, which is www.P65Warnings.ca.gov
Unlike standard item specifics that allow a maximum of 65 characters in the Value field, the matching value for the 'California Prop 65 Warning' item specific allows up to 800 characters of text. When a seller passes in this item specific, eBay will automatically insert a warning symbol icon for the listing.

LostList.ItemArray.Item
  .Variations.Variation
  .VariationSpecifics
  .NameValueList.Name	string	Conditionally	Depending on the call and context, this value is either a name of an Item/Variation Specific, or a Parts Compatibility name.

For the AddItem and AddFixedPriceItem families of calls: In the Item.ItemSpecifics context, the value in this field will either be the name of a required/recommended/optional item specific name for the category, or it may be a seller's customized item specific name.

For the AddFixedPriceItem family of calls: In the Compatibility.NameValueList context, this value is a motor vehicle aspect such as Year, Make, and Model. A Compatibility.NameValueList container is applicable for motor vehicle parts and accessories listings.

For PlaceOffer: Required if the line item being purchased is an item variation within a multiple-variation listing.

Note: For required and recommended item specifics that are returned in the getItemAspectsForCategory method of the Taxonomy API, the seller should pass in the name of these item specifics just as they are shown in the getItemAspectsForCategory response. Similarly, for catalog-enabled categories, the seller should pass in the name of instance aspects just as they are shown in the getItemAspectsForCategory response. Instance aspects are additional details unique to a specific item or listing that a seller can include along with the product aspects that are already defined in the eBay catalog product associated with the listing. Instance aspects common to many catalog-enabled categories include 'Bundle Description' and 'Modification Description'. eBay US sellers who ship to California are required to pass in a 'California Prop 65 Warning' item specific if the item in the listing contains one or more chemicals known to be harmful to human health. This item specific is passed at the listing level for both single-variation and multiple-variation listings. The 'California Prop 65 Warning' is considered an instance specific because it will be retained on the listing even when the seller lists using an eBay catalog product. The 'California Prop 65 Warning' may be applicable in most eBay US categories, including eBay Motors, Motors Parts & Accessories, and catalog-enabled categories.
Note: If Brand and MPN (Manufacturer Part Number) are being used to identify product variations in a multiple-variation listing, the Brand must be specified at the item level (ItemSpecifics container) and the MPN for each product variation must be specified at the variation level (VariationSpecifics container). The Brand name must be the same for all variations within a single listing.

Max length: 65.

  .NameValueList.Value	string	Conditionally,
repeatable: [0..*]	Depending on the call and context, this value is either the value of an Item/Variation Specific, a Parts Compatibility value, or a product identifier.

For the AddItem family of calls: Multiple values can only be specified for an Item Specific if the itemToAspectCardinality field of the getItemAspectsForCategory method shows a value of MULTI. If an item specific only supports a single value, only the first item specific value specified in the request will be used.

For the Compatibility.NameValueList context, this is the corresponding value of a motor vehicle aspect such as Year, Make, and Model. A Compatibility.NameValueList container is applicable for motor vehicle parts and accessories listings.

For PlaceOffer: Required if the line item being purchased is an item variation within a multiple-variation listing.

Note: The standard maximum length for the value of an item specific is 65, but the maximum allowed length increases for instance aspects such as 'Bundle Description' and 'Modification Description'. For item specifics with max lengths greater than 65, the actual max length will be returned in a corresponding aspectMaxLength field. The maximum allowed length for the new 'California Prop 65 Warning' item specific is 800 characters. For more information about the 'California Prop 65 Warning' item specific, see the ItemSpecifics.NameValueList field description.

Max length: 65 (but longer for some instance aspects, including 800 for 'California Prop 65 Warning').

This field will only be returned if set for an item, and only returned to the user who created the note.

Not supported as input in ReviseItem. Use SetUserNotes instead.

For GetMyeBayBuying In WatchList, notes for variations are only returned at the Item level, not the variation level. They are only set if you specified ItemID (if no purchases) or ItemID and VariationSpecifics (if there are purchases) in SetUserNotes (or selected the equivalent in the My eBay UI on the site).

In WonList, notes for variations are only returned at the Item level, not the variation level. They are only set if you specified ItemID and TransactionID in SetUserNotes (or selected the equivalent in the My eBay UI on the site).
SecondChanceOffer.Site	SiteCodeType	Conditionally	The name of the eBay listing site. The listing site affects the business logic and validation rules that are applied to the request, which in turn affect the values that are returned in the response, as well as values that appear on the eBay site. For example, the listing site can affect the validation of Category in listing requests, international business seller requirements, the values of converted (localized) prices in responses, the item-related time stamps that are displayed on the eBay site, the visibility of the item in some types of searches (e.g., GetCategoryListings), and other information. In some cases, the rules are determined by a combination of the site, the user's registration address, and other information. You cannot change the site when you revise a listing.

When you specify Item.Site in AddItem or AddFixedPriceItem, it must be consistent with the numeric site ID that you specify in the request URL (for the SOAP API) or the X-EBAY-API-SITEID header (for the XML API).

You cannot use HTML or JavaScript in the Title. (HTML characters will be interpreted literally as plain text.)

The listing title can only be changed if the active listing has yet to have any bids or sales, and the listing does not end within 12 hours.
Note: When making a GetSellerEvents call, this field will be returned masked as ***************** for on-hold listings.
Note: When making a GetSellerTransactions or GetMyeBaySelling call, the item ID value of the listing will be returned in this field to indicate that the listing is on hold.

UserDefinedList.ItemArray.Item	ItemType	Conditionally,
repeatable: [0..*]	Contains the data properties that define one item listing. GetSellerEvents and GetSellerList only return items if any are available for the seller within the time window specified in the request.

Some optional fields are only returned if the seller defined them for the item. Some fields are only returned under particular conditions specified in the individual field descriptions. For example, a buyer's contact information might only be returned if the member who is making the request (as identified in the eBayAuthToken) has an order relationship with that buyer.

For calls that support detail levels, the set of fields returned is also controlled by the value of DetailLevel in the request. For some calls, other parameters in the request can also control the data returned for each item. For example, GranularityLevel controls the fields to return for each item in the GetSellerList response.
Note: When making a GetSellerList call, items that are on-hold due to an eBay policy violation will not be returned in the response.

This field will only be returned if set for an item, and only returned to the user who created the note.

Not supported as input in ReviseItem. Use SetUserNotes instead.

For GetMyeBayBuying In WatchList, notes for variations are only returned at the Item level, not the variation level. They are only set if you specified ItemID (if no purchases) or ItemID and VariationSpecifics (if there are purchases) in SetUserNotes (or selected the equivalent in the My eBay UI on the site).

In WonList, notes for variations are only returned at the Item level, not the variation level. They are only set if you specified ItemID and TransactionID in SetUserNotes (or selected the equivalent in the My eBay UI on the site).

DetailLevel: ReturnAll. Also returned if DetailLevel is not provided on input.
WatchList.ItemArray.Item
  .BuyItNowPrice	AmountType (double)	Conditionally	This field is only applicable for auction listings. By specifying a 'Buy It Now' price, a seller is allowing prospective buyers the opportunity to purchase the item in the auction listing at this price immediately. When a buyer uses the 'Buy It Now' option to purchase the item, the auction listing will end immediately.

By including this field and specifying a 'Buy It Now' price, the seller is enabling the 'Buy It Now' feature on the auction listing. If the seller includes this field for any other listing type other than an auction, this field and its price will just be ignored.

The price in this field must be at least 30 percent higher than the starting bid price (which is specified in an Add call through the Item.StartPrice field). Once a bid is made on an auction listing, and the bid meets or exceeds the Item.ReservePrice value (if set), the 'Buy It Now' option becomes unavailable, and this field will no longer be applicable. If there is no Reserve Price, the first bid will nullify the 'Buy It Now' option.

Keep in mind that GetItem (and other 'Get' calls that retrieve the Item details) may still return the BuyItNowPrice field for an auction item even if the 'Buy It Now' option is no longer available. Instead, a user should look for the ListingDetails.BuyItNowAvailable boolean field in the GetItem response to determine if the 'Buy It Now' option is still available for the auction item.

Note: For the US site, new eBay sellers are subject to Seller Limits, which limit the quantity of items that may be listed and/or the total cumulative value of these listings. While subject to these selling limits, an eBay seller can use the GetMyeBaySelling call to retrieve both the remaining number of listings they can create and the remaining cumulative value of these listings. These values are shown in the Summary.QuantityLimitRemaining and Summary.AmountLimitRemaining fields in the GetMyeBaySelling response. If a call to add an item or revise an item would result in the exceeding of these limits, the add item or revise item call will fail. These fields will only be returned if the seller is subject to seller limits.

  .BuyItNowPrice
  [ attribute currencyID ]	CurrencyCodeType	Conditionally	This field is only applicable for auction listings.

When a buyer uses the 'Buy It Now' option to purchase the item, the auction listing will end immediately.

By including this field and specifying a 'Buy It Now' price, the seller is enabling the 'Buy It Now' feature on the auction listing. If the seller includes this field for any other listing type other than an auction, this field and its price will just be ignored.

If there is no Reserve Price, the first bid will nullify the 'Buy It Now' option.

Keep in mind that GetItem (and other 'Get' calls that retrieve the Item details) may still return the BuyItNowPrice field for an auction item even if the 'Buy It Now' option is no longer available. Instead, a user should look for the ListingDetails.BuyItNowAvailable boolean field in the GetItem response to determine if the 'Buy It Now' option is still available for the auction item.

Note: For the US site, new eBay sellers are subject to Seller Limits, which limit the quantity of items that may be listed and/or the total cumulative value of these listings. While subject to these selling limits, an eBay seller can use the GetMyeBaySelling call to retrieve both the remaining number of listings they can create and the remaining cumulative value of these listings. These values are shown in the Summary.QuantityLimitRemaining and Summary.AmountLimitRemaining fields in the GetMyeBaySelling response. If a call to add an item or revise an item would result in the exceeding of these limits, the add item or revise item call will fail. These fields will only be returned if the seller is subject to seller limits.

WatchList.ItemArray.Item
  .Seller.FeedbackScore	int	Conditionally	The aggregate feedback score for a user. A user's feedback score is the net positive feedback minus the net negative feedback left for the user. Feedback scores are a quantitative expression of the desirability of dealing with a user as a buyer or a seller in either side of an order.

Each order line item can result in one feedback entry for a given user (the buyer can leave feedback for the seller, and the seller can leave feedback for the buyer.). That one feedback can be positive, negative, or neutral. The aggregated feedback counts for a particular user represent that user's overall feedback score (referred to as a "feedback rating" on the eBay site).

If the user has chosen to make their feedback private and that user is not the user identified in the request's authentication token, FeedbackScore is not returned and FeedbackPrivate is returned with a value of true.

In GetMyeBayBuying and GetMyeBaySelling, feedback information (FeedbackScore and FeedbackRatingStar) is returned in BidList.ItemArray.Item.Seller. For GetMyeBayBuying, the feedback score of each seller with an item having received a bid from the buyer is returned. For GetMyeBaySelling, the feedback score of the seller is returned.

GetMyeBayBuying and GetMyeBaySelling also return feedback information (FeedbackScore and FeedbackRatingStar) in BidList.ItemArray.Item.SellingStatus.HighBidder. GetMyeBayBuying returns feedback information on the high bidder of each item the buyer is bidding on. GetMyeBaySelling returns feedback information on the high bidder of each item the seller is selling.

Since a bidder's user info is anonymous, the real feedback score will be returned only to that bidder, and to the seller of an item that the user is bidding on. For all other users, the value -99 is returned.

For GetOrders and GetItemTransactions only: If using Trading WSDL Version 1019 or above, this field will only be returned to the buyer or seller, and no longer returned at all to third parties. If using a Trading WSDL older than Version 1019, the accurate Feedback Score for the user is returned to the buyer or seller, but a dummy value of 0 will be returned to all third parties.

DetailLevel: ReturnAll. Also returned if DetailLevel is not provided on input.

WatchList.ItemArray.Item
  .Seller.UserID	UserIDType (string)	Conditionally	Unique eBay user ID for the user.

Note: Effective September 26, 2025, select developers will no longer receive username data for U.S. users through this field. Instead, an immutable user ID will be returned in its place. For more information, please refer to Data Handling Compliance.

Since a bidder's user info is anonymous, this tag contains the actual value of an ID only for that bidder, and for the seller of an item that the user is bidding on. For other users, the actual value is replaced by an anonymous value, according to these rules:

When bidding on items, UserID is replaced with the value "a****b" where a and b are random characters from the UserID. For example, if the UserID = IBidALot, it might be displayed as, "I****A".

Important: In this format, the anonymous bidder ID can change for each auction.
For GetMyeBayBuying only, when bidding on items: UserID is replaced with the value "a****b" where a and b are random characters from the UserID.

When bidding on items listed on the Philippines site: UserID is replaced with the value "Bidder X" where X is a number indicating the order of that user's first bid. For example, if the user was the third bidder, UserID = Bidder 3. Note that in this Philippines site format, the anonymous bidder ID stays the same for a given auction, but is different for different auctions. For example, a bidder who is the third and then the seventh bidder in an auction will be listed for both bids as "Bidder 3". However, if that same bidder is the first bidder on a different auction, the bidder will be listed for that auction as "Bidder 1", not "Bidder 3".

For GetMyeBayBuying only, when bidding on items listed on the UK and AU sites: UserID is replaced with the string "High Bidder".

For PlaceOffer, see also SellingStatus.HighBidder.

In GetMyeBayBuying and GetMyeBaySelling, feedback information (FeedbackScore and FeedbackRatingStar) is returned in BidList.ItemArray.Item.Seller. For GetMyeBayBuying, the feedback score of each seller with an item having received a bid from the buyer is returned. For GetMyeBaySelling, the feedback score of the seller is returned.

GetMyeBayBuying and GetMyeBaySelling also return feedback information (FeedbackScore and FeedbackRatingStar) in BidList.ItemArray.Item.SellingStatus.HighBidder. GetMyeBayBuying returns feedback information on the high bidder of each item the buyer is bidding on. GetMyeBaySelling returns feedback information on the high bidder of each item the seller is selling.

Since a bidder's user info is anonymous, the real feedback score will be returned only to that bidder, and to the seller of an item that the user is bidding on. For all other users, the value -99 is returned.

For GetOrders and GetItemTransactions only: If using Trading WSDL Version 1019 or above, this field will only be returned to the buyer or seller, and no longer returned at all to third parties. If using a Trading WSDL older than Version 1019, the accurate Feedback Score for the user is returned to the buyer or seller, but a dummy value of 0 will be returned to all third parties.

  .UserID	UserIDType (string)	Conditionally	Unique eBay user ID for the user.

Note: Effective September 26, 2025, select developers will no longer receive username data for U.S. users through this field. Instead, an immutable user ID will be returned in its place. For more information, please refer to Data Handling Compliance.

Since a bidder's user info is anonymous, this tag contains the actual value of an ID only for that bidder, and for the seller of an item that the user is bidding on. For other users, the actual value is replaced by an anonymous value, according to these rules:

When bidding on items, UserID is replaced with the value "a****b" where a and b are random characters from the UserID. For example, if the UserID = IBidALot, it might be displayed as, "I****A".

Important: In this format, the anonymous bidder ID can change for each auction.
For GetMyeBayBuying only, when bidding on items: UserID is replaced with the value "a****b" where a and b are random characters from the UserID.

When bidding on items listed on the Philippines site: UserID is replaced with the value "Bidder X" where X is a number indicating the order of that user's first bid. For example, if the user was the third bidder, UserID = Bidder 3. Note that in this Philippines site format, the anonymous bidder ID stays the same for a given auction, but is different for different auctions. For example, a bidder who is the third and then the seventh bidder in an auction will be listed for both bids as "Bidder 3". However, if that same bidder is the first bidder on a different auction, the bidder will be listed for that auction as "Bidder 1", not "Bidder 3".

For GetMyeBayBuying only, when bidding on items listed on the UK and AU sites: UserID is replaced with the string "High Bidder".

Note: For sellers who are using a shipping (aka Fulfillment) business policy to create/revise/relist an item, none of the fields under the ShippingDetails container are necessary. A fulfillment business policy can be set up and/or modified in My eBay, or via the Account API. A fulfillment business policy is associated to a listing through the Item.SellerProfiles.SellerShippingProfile container.

If you do not use a fulfillment business policy, many of the fields under this ShippingDetails container become required in your request.
Note: For ReviseItem and ReviseFixedPriceItem calls: If you are updating any field under the ShippingDetails container, you must include all containers and fields set under this container even if their values are not changing. If you do not do this, some fields may be removed from the listing. To find out the values included in the current listing, call GetItem and look through the ShippingDetails container in the response. For additional information, see Revise shipping details.
New users who list their first items in selected categories on the US site must specify at least one domestic shipping service. This applies to a category if GetCategoryFeatures returns true for Category.ShippingTermsRequired.

For multi-quantity, fixed-price listings, a seller can revise all shipping details of the listing (except for sales tax and for shipping type of Freight) for all unsold items. This applies to both domestic and international shipping. Checkout is not affected for those who bought items prior to the seller's shipping changes—the shipping details that were in effect at the time of purchase are used for that buyer at the time of checkout.

Shipping details are not applicable to any classified ad listings, as shipping/delivery/pickup is handled by the buyer and seller off of the eBay platform.

Note: To create a listing that is 'Local Pickup only' (buyer picks up, with no shipping/delivery available), the user does the following two things:
Either omit the entire ShippingDetails container, or pass in an empty ShippingDetails container - <ShippingDetails/>
Pass in one ShipToLocations field, with its value set to None - <ShipToLocations>None</ShipToLocations>

For GetMyeBayBuying, GetMyeBaySelling: ShippingDetails is not returned.

  .InternationalShippingServiceOption	InternationalShippingServiceOptionsType	Conditionally,
repeatable: [0..*]	Shipping costs and options related to an international shipping service. If used, at least one domestic shipping service must also be provided in ShippingServiceOptions.

If you specify multiple InternationalShippingServiceOption nodes, the repeating nodes must be contiguous. That is, you cannot insert other nodes between InternationalShippingServiceOption nodes.

All specified domestic and international shipping services must be the same shipping type (for example, Flat versus Calculated).

A seller can offer up to four domestic shipping services and up to five international shipping services. However, if the seller is opted in to the Global Shipping Program or eBay International Shipping, only four other international shipping services may be offered (regardless of whether or not Global Shipping or eBay International Shipping is offered for the listing).

If you specify ShippingDetails when you revise or relist an item but you omit InternationalShippingServiceOption, eBay will drop the international shipping services (except the Global Shipping Program or eBay International Shipping) from the listing. This may also have unintended side effects, as other fields that depend on this data may be dropped as well. To retain the shipping services and dependent fields when you modify other shipping details, it may be simplest to specify all ShippingDetails that you still want to include in the listing.

For GetItemShipping, results are filtered: if any service is not available in the buyer's region, it is removed. If no services remain after this filtering, a warning is returned.

A separate ShippingServiceOptions container is needed for each domestic shipping service option that is available to ship the item. Unless a fulfillment business policy is being used, generally at least one ShippingServiceOptions container will be required.

If you specify multiple ShippingServiceOptions nodes, the repeating nodes must be contiguous. For example, you can insert InternationalShippingServiceOption nodes after a list of repeating ShippingServiceOptions nodes, but not between them:

<ShippingServiceOptions>...</ShippingServiceOptions>
<ShippingServiceOptions>...</ShippingServiceOptions>
<ShippingServiceOptions>...</ShippingServiceOptions>
<InternationalShippingServiceOption>...</InternationalShippingServiceOption>
<InternationalShippingServiceOption>...</InternationalShippingServiceOption>

If you specify ShippingDetails when you revise or relist an item but you omit ShippingServiceOptions, eBay will drop the domestic shipping services from the listing. This may also have unintended side effects, as other fields that depend on this data may be dropped as well.

All specified domestic and international shipping services must be the same shipping type (for example, Flat versus Calculated).

Note: If the seller has set the shipping cost model to 'Flat' or 'Calculated' (ShippingDetails.ShippingType field), at least one actual shipping service option must be specified through a ShippingServiceOptions container. In the past, eBay allowed users to set the shipping cost model to 'Flat' or 'Calculated', and then just pass in one ShippingServiceOptions container with the ShippingServiceOptions.ShipppingService value set to a 'Local Pickup' option. Now, sellers must pass in at least one actual domestic shipping service option in addition to any 'Local Pickup' option, or the listing will be blocked with the following error: 17510 - You must specify at least one domestic shipping service, other than or in addition to Local Pickup.

For GetItemShipping, results are filtered: if any service is not available in the buyer's region, it is removed. If no services remain after this filtering, a warning is returned.

  .FreeShipping	boolean	Conditionally	This boolean field indicates whether or not the corresponding domestic shipping service option is free to the buyer. In an Add/Revise/Relist call, free shipping can only be offered for the first specified shipping service (so, the corresponding ShippingServicePriority value should be 1 or included first in the call request). If 'free shipping' is for any other shipping service, this field is ignored.

For 'Get' calls, including GetItem, this field is only returned if 1.
Note: If a seller is specifying a shipping service option as 'free shipping', in addition to this FreeShipping boolean field, the seller will also need to include the corresponding ShippingServiceCost field and set its value to 0.0, as eBay will not do this automatically.
Note: If the condition is certified refurbished (ConditionID set to 2000, 'Certified - Refurbished'), you must offer a free shipping option. Set FreeShipping as true (or 1) along with the ShippingServiceCost as 0.0 for the first domestic shipping service.

The LocalPickup flag can also be used with other fields to indicate if there is no fee for local pickup.

For example, if the LocalPickup flag is used with the ShippingServiceOptions and ShippingServiceCost fields, the seller can indicate that local pickup is an available option and that no is fee charged. This is the equivalent of free shipping.

This field is required to identify each domestic shipping service option that is specified with a ShippingServiceOptions container.

For a list of valid ShippingService values, call GeteBayDetails with DetailName set to ShippingServiceDetails. The ShippingServiceDetails.ValidForSellingFlow flag must also be present. Otherwise, that particular shipping service option is no longer valid and cannot be offered to buyers through a listing.

To view the full list of domestic shipping service options in the response, look for the ShippingServiceDetails.ShippingService fields. Domestic shipping service options will not have a InternationalService = true field, as this indicates that the ShippingService value is an International shipping service option.

Note: The eBay standard envelope (eSE) is a domestic envelope service with tracking through eBay. This service applies to specific sub-categories of Trading Cards, and to coins & paper money, postcards, stamps, patches, and similar eligible categories, and is only available on the US marketplace.

Generally, the seller will give the buyer a shipping discount if that buyer purchases multiple quantity of the item, so this value should usually be less than the value set for ShippingServiceCost.

The value of this field can even be set to 0 if the seller wants to encourage buyers to buy multiple quantity of the item, or it could be that the seller can fit multiple quantities of the line item in a single shipping package, so the seller is just passing this shipping savings onto the buyer.

In the case of a multiple-quantity, fixed-price listing, the ShippingServiceAdditionalCost field also becomes applicable, and shows the cost to ship each additional unit of the item if the buyer purchases multiple quantity of the same line item.

Note: If the corresponding shipping service option is set as a 'free shipping' option (FreeShipping set to true) and flat-rate shipping is being used domestically (ShippingType is set to Flat or FlatDomesticCalculatedInternational), the seller must still include this ShippingServiceCost field and set its value to 0.0, as eBay will not do this automatically. Do not include ShippingServiceCost when the domestic shipping service option is set to represent domestic calculated shipping (ShippingType is set to Calculated or CalculatedDomesticFlatInternational), as error 10019 occurs.

When returned by GetItemShipping, it includes the packaging and handling cost.

Note that if ShippingService is set to LocalPickup, ShippingServiceCost must be set to 0.0. Also, if a shipping service has been specified (even LocalPickup), GetItem returns the shipping service cost, even if the cost is zero.

For auction listings: Competitive bidding starts at this value. Once at least one bid has been placed, StartPrice remains the same but CurrentPrice is incremented to the amount of each succeeding bid. If ReservePrice is also specified, the value of StartPrice must be lower than the value of ReservePrice.

For input on fixed-price listings (FixedPriceItem): This is the constant price at which a buyer may purchase the item.

GetMyeBaySelling does not return Item.StartPrice for fixed price items—it returns Item.SellingStatus.CurrentPrice.

For AddFixedPriceItem and VerifyAddFixedPriceItem: Required when no variations are specified. If variations are specified, use Variation.StartPrice for each variation instead.

For Revise calls: If the StartPrice value for a fixed-price item is changed with a Revise call, the MinimumBestOfferPrice and BestOfferAutoAcceptPrice fields in the ListingDetails container will be dropped (if set), basically turning off the Best Offer Auto Accept and/or Auto Decline features. If the seller wanted to reintroduce either of these Best Offer threshold values in the listing again, an additional Revise call would have to be made, passing in the desired threshold values.

Note: For the US site, new eBay sellers are subject to Seller Limits, which limit the quantity of items that may be listed and/or the total cumulative value of these listings. While subject to these selling limits, an eBay seller can use the GetMyeBaySelling call to retrieve both the remaining number of listings they can create and the remaining cumulative value of these listings. These values are shown in the Summary.QuantityLimitRemaining and Summary.AmountLimitRemaining fields in the GetMyeBaySelling response. If a call to add an item or revise an item would result in the exceeding of these limits, the add item or revise item call will fail. These fields will only be returned if the seller is subject to seller limits.

  .Variations	VariationsType	Conditionally	
Variations are similar (but not identical) items in a multiple-variation, fixed-price listing. For example, a T-shirt listing could contain multiple items of the same brand that vary by color and size (like "Blue, Large" and "Black, Medium"). Each variation specifies a combination of one of these colors and sizes. Each variation can have a different quantity and price. You can buy multiple items from one variation at the same time. (That is, one order line item can contain multiple items from a single variation.)

If you list in two categories, both categories must support listing with variations. See VariationsEnabled in GetCategoryFeatures to determine applicable categories.

For ReviseFixedPriceItem and RelistFixedPriceItem: Once a listing has been submitted with variations, you can't delete all the variations when you revise or relist the listing (because it would be considered a different listing). You also can't add or change variation specifics (because they are unique identifiers). However, you can delete or replace individual variations as needed to match your current inventory. If a variation has no purchases, use the Variation.Delete field to delete the variation. If it has inventory, set the Quantity to 0.

As a best practice, if you want to revise multiple variations in the same listing at the same time (i.e., within a very short period), use a single ReviseFixedPriceItem request and include all the variation revisions in the same request. If your application design requires you to revise each variation individually, then avoid using multiple parallel threads. Instead, use a serial, synchronous process. That is, wait until each revision has been processed by eBay before submitting the next revision request for another variation in the same listing.

WatchList.ItemArray.Item
  .Variations.Variation	VariationType	Conditionally,
repeatable: [0..*]	
Contains data that distinguishes one item variation from another. For example, if an item varies by color and size, each Variation node specifies a combination of one of those colors and sizes.

When listing or relisting an item, you are allowed to create a listing with only one item variation, and you might have a plan to add more item variations to the listing in the future. However, if you don't plan to add other item variations in the future, we recommend that you avoid listing with only one variation, so that you avoid confusing buyers.

If you specify multiple Variation containers in an add/revise/relist/verify add call to define multiple item variations, the Variation containers must be contiguous or an error will occur. This means that you would not want to input a Pictures or a VariationSpecificsSet container in between Variation containers in an API call.

When you modify an item variation with a ReviseFixedPriceItem call, the best practice is to include all applicable fields under the Variation container, even if some of the values/settings are not being modified. The StartPrice and VariationSpecifics must be included when modifying an existing item variation, even if these values are not being changed. If a SKU value is defined for the item variation, it is strongly recommended that you include the SKU field, regardless of whether the SKU value is changing or not. If the SKU field is not included, any existing SKU value will be removed from the item variation. It is also strongly recommended that you include the Quantity field and input an accurate value, because if the Quantity field is omitted in the API call, the quantity for the item variation is set to 0.
Note: The Item.Variations container and its child fields will stop being returned in GetItemTransactions on January 31, 2024.


DetailLevel: ReturnAll. Also returned if DetailLevel is not provided on input.
See Multiple-variation listings.

WatchList.ItemArray.Item
  .Variations.Variation
  .VariationSpecifics	NameValueListArrayType	Conditionally,
repeatable: [2..5]	
A list of name/value pairs that uniquely identify the variation within the listing. All variations must specify the same set of Item Specific names, but each variation must provide a unique combination of values for those Item Specific names. For example, if the items vary by color and size, then every variation must specify 'Color' and 'Size' as Item Specific names, but no two variations can specify the same combination of 'Color' and 'Size' values.

When you revise a listing that includes variations, you can change names of Variationpecifics by using the Variations.ModifyNameList container. You can also add, delete, or replace individual variations as needed to match your current inventory. Use the Variation.Delete field to delete a variation that has no sales (order line items). If the variation has sales, then set the Quantity to 0.

For GetSellerEvents To keep the GetSellerEvents response smaller, Variationpecifics are not returned if the variation has a SKU. If the variation has no SKU, then Variationpecifics are returned instead. Optionally, you can pass IncludeVariationSpecifics as true in the request to force Variationpecifics to be returned, even when the SKU is returned.
Note: The Item.Variations container and its child fields will stop being returned in GetItemTransactions on January 31, 2024.

  .Variations.Variation
  .VariationSpecifics
  .NameValueList	NameValueListType	Conditionally,
repeatable: [0..*]	For the AddItem family of calls: Contains the name and value(s) for an Item Specific. Only required when the ItemSpecifics container is specified.
For the AddFixedPriceItem family of calls: The same NameValueList schema is used for the ItemSpecifics node, the VariationSpecifics node, and the VariationSpecifcsSet node.

If the listing has variations, any name that you use in the VariationSpecifics and VariationSpecificsSet nodes can't be used in the ItemSpecifics node.
When you list with Item Variations:
Specify shared Item Specifics (e.g., Brand) in the ItemSpecifics node.
Specify up to five VariationSpecifics in each Variation node.
Specify all applicable names with all their supported values in the VariationSpecificSet node.
See the Variation sample in the AddFixedPriceItem call reference for examples.

For PlaceOffer: Required if the item being purchased includes Item Variations.

For AddToWatchList and RemoveFromWatchList: The ItemID value of the multiple-variation listing and the name-value pair to identify each variation in the listing are required.

Note: As of August 30, 2018, California will require sellers to display a Proposition 65 warning on online retail sites if products contain chemicals and/or substances that may impact the health of California buyers. This requirement is applicable to most eBay US categories, including eBay Motors, Motors Parts & Accessories, and catalog-enabled categories. The warning message can be customized by the seller, but should contain the following basic information:
The name of at least one listed chemical that prompted the warning
Text stating that the product 'can expose you to' the chemical(s) in the product
The URL for OEHHA's new Proposition 65 warnings website, which is www.P65Warnings.ca.gov
Unlike standard item specifics that allow a maximum of 65 characters in the Value field, the matching value for the 'California Prop 65 Warning' item specific allows up to 800 characters of text. When a seller passes in this item specific, eBay will automatically insert a warning symbol icon for the listing.

WatchList.ItemArray.Item
  .Variations.Variation
  .VariationSpecifics
  .NameValueList.Name	string	Conditionally	Depending on the call and context, this value is either a name of an Item/Variation Specific, or a Parts Compatibility name.

For the AddItem and AddFixedPriceItem families of calls: In the Item.ItemSpecifics context, the value in this field will either be the name of a required/recommended/optional item specific name for the category, or it may be a seller's customized item specific name.

For the AddFixedPriceItem family of calls: In the Compatibility.NameValueList context, this value is a motor vehicle aspect such as Year, Make, and Model. A Compatibility.NameValueList container is applicable for motor vehicle parts and accessories listings.

For PlaceOffer: Required if the line item being purchased is an item variation within a multiple-variation listing.

Note: For required and recommended item specifics that are returned in the getItemAspectsForCategory method of the Taxonomy API, the seller should pass in the name of these item specifics just as they are shown in the getItemAspectsForCategory response. Similarly, for catalog-enabled categories, the seller should pass in the name of instance aspects just as they are shown in the getItemAspectsForCategory response. Instance aspects are additional details unique to a specific item or listing that a seller can include along with the product aspects that are already defined in the eBay catalog product associated with the listing. Instance aspects common to many catalog-enabled categories include 'Bundle Description' and 'Modification Description'. eBay US sellers who ship to California are required to pass in a 'California Prop 65 Warning' item specific if the item in the listing contains one or more chemicals known to be harmful to human health. This item specific is passed at the listing level for both single-variation and multiple-variation listings. The 'California Prop 65 Warning' is considered an instance specific because it will be retained on the listing even when the seller lists using an eBay catalog product. The 'California Prop 65 Warning' may be applicable in most eBay US categories, including eBay Motors, Motors Parts & Accessories, and catalog-enabled categories.
Note: If Brand and MPN (Manufacturer Part Number) are being used to identify product variations in a multiple-variation listing, the Brand must be specified at the item level (ItemSpecifics container) and the MPN for each product variation must be specified at the variation level (VariationSpecifics container). The Brand name must be the same for all variations within a single listing.

Max length: 65.

  .NameValueList.Value	string	Conditionally,

For the AddItem family of calls: Multiple values can only be specified for an Item Specific if the itemToAspectCardinality field of the getItemAspectsForCategory method shows a value of MULTI. If an item specific only supports a single value, only the first item specific value specified in the request will be used.

For the Compatibility.NameValueList context, this is the corresponding value of a motor vehicle aspect such as Year, Make, and Model. A Compatibility.NameValueList container is applicable for motor vehicle parts and accessories listings.

For PlaceOffer: Required if the line item being purchased is an item variation within a multiple-variation listing.

Note: The standard maximum length for the value of an item specific is 65, but the maximum allowed length increases for instance aspects such as 'Bundle Description' and 'Modification Description'. For item specifics with max lengths greater than 65, the actual max length will be returned in a corresponding aspectMaxLength field. The maximum allowed length for the new 'California Prop 65 Warning' item specific is 800 characters. For more information about the 'California Prop 65 Warning' item specific, see the ItemSpecifics.NameValueList field description.

Max length: 65 (but longer for some instance aspects, including 800 for 'California Prop 65 Warning').

If you specify multiple InternationalShippingServiceOption nodes, the repeating nodes must be contiguous. That is, you cannot insert other nodes between InternationalShippingServiceOption nodes.

All specified domestic and international shipping services must be the same shipping type (for example, Flat versus Calculated).

A seller can offer up to four domestic shipping services and up to five international shipping services. However, if the seller is opted in to the Global Shipping Program or eBay International Shipping, only four other international shipping services may be offered (regardless of whether or not Global Shipping or eBay International Shipping is offered for the listing).

If you specify ShippingDetails when you revise or relist an item but you omit InternationalShippingServiceOption, eBay will drop the international shipping services (except the Global Shipping Program or eBay International Shipping) from the listing. This may also have unintended side effects, as other fields that depend on this data may be dropped as well. To retain the shipping services and dependent fields when you modify other shipping details, it may be simplest to specify all ShippingDetails that you still want to include in the listing.

For GetItemShipping, results are filtered: if any service is not available in the buyer's region, it is removed. If no services remain after this filtering, a warning is returned.

repeatable: [0..*]	This container is used to provide details on a specific domestic shipping service option, including the unique identifier of the shipping service option and the costs related to domestic shipping service. A separate ShippingServiceOptions container is needed for each domestic shipping service option that is available to ship the item. Unless a fulfillment business policy is being used, generally at least one ShippingServiceOptions container will be required.

If you specify multiple ShippingServiceOptions nodes, the repeating nodes must be contiguous. For example, you can insert InternationalShippingServiceOption nodes after a list of repeating ShippingServiceOptions nodes, but not between them:

<ShippingServiceOptions>...</ShippingServiceOptions>
<ShippingServiceOptions>...</ShippingServiceOptions>
<ShippingServiceOptions>...</ShippingServiceOptions>
<InternationalShippingServiceOption>...</InternationalShippingServiceOption>

If you specify ShippingDetails when you revise or relist an item but you omit ShippingServiceOptions, eBay will drop the domestic shipping services from the listing. This may also have unintended side effects, as other fields that depend on this data may be dropped as well.

To retain the shipping services and dependent fields when you modify other shipping details, it may be simplest to specify all ShippingDetails that you still want to include in the listing.

All specified domestic and international shipping services must be the same shipping type (for example, Flat versus Calculated).

Note: If the seller has set the shipping cost model to 'Flat' or 'Calculated' (ShippingDetails.ShippingType field), at least one actual shipping service option must be specified through a ShippingServiceOptions container. In the past, eBay allowed users to set the shipping cost model to 'Flat' or 'Calculated', and then just pass in one ShippingServiceOptions container with the ShippingServiceOptions.ShipppingService value set to a 'Local Pickup' option. Now, sellers must pass in at least one actual domestic shipping service option in addition to any 'Local Pickup' option, or the listing will be blocked with the following error: 17510 - You must specify at least one domestic shipping service, other than or in addition to Local Pickup.

For GetItemShipping, results are filtered: if any service is not available in the buyer's region, it is removed. If no services remain after this filtering, a warning is returned.

For 'Get' calls, including GetItem, this field is only returned if 1.
Note: If a seller is specifying a shipping service option as 'free shipping', in addition to this FreeShipping boolean field, the seller will also need to include the corresponding ShippingServiceCost field and set its value to 0.0, as eBay will not do this automatically.
Note: If the condition is certified refurbished (ConditionID set to 2000, 'Certified - Refurbished'), you must offer a free shipping option. Set FreeShipping as true (or 1) along with the ShippingServiceCost as 0.0 for the first domestic shipping service.

This service applies to specific sub-categories of Trading Cards, and to coins & paper money, postcards, stamps, patches, and similar eligible categories, and is only available on the US marketplace. See eBay standard envelope for details, restrictions, and an envelope size template. To use this service, send envelopes using the USPS mail and set the ShippingService field to US_eBayStandardEnvelope.

  .ShippingServiceAdditionalCost	AmountType (double)	Conditionally	The cost of shipping each additional item if the same buyer purchases multiple quantity of the same line item. This field is required when creating a multiple-quantity, fixed-price listing. Generally, the seller will give the buyer a shipping discount if that buyer purchases multiple quantity of the item, so this value should usually be less than the value set for ShippingServiceCost.

The value of this field can even be set to 0 if the seller wants to encourage buyers to buy multiple quantity of the item, or it could be that the seller can fit multiple quantities of the line item in a single shipping package, so the seller is just passing this shipping savings onto the buyer. This field is not applicable for single-quantity listings.

Note: If the corresponding shipping service option is set as a 'free shipping' option (FreeShipping set to true) and flat-rate shipping is being used domestically (ShippingType is set to Flat or FlatDomesticCalculatedInternational), the seller must still include this ShippingServiceCost field and set its value to 0.0, as eBay will not do this automatically. Do not include ShippingServiceCost when the domestic shipping service option is set to represent domestic calculated shipping (ShippingType is set to Calculated or CalculatedDomesticFlatInternational), as error 10019 occurs.

Note: Effective September 26, 2025, select developers will no longer receive username data for U.S. users through this field. Instead, an immutable user ID will be returned in its place. For more information, please refer to Data Handling Compliance.

Since a bidder's user info is anonymous, this tag contains the actual value of an ID only for that bidder, and for the seller of an item that the user is bidding on. For other users, the actual value is replaced by an anonymous value, according to these rules:

When bidding on items, UserID is replaced with the value "a****b" where a and b are random characters from the UserID. For example, if the UserID = IBidALot, it might be displayed as, "I****A".

Important: In this format, the anonymous bidder ID can change for each auction.
For GetMyeBayBuying only, when bidding on items: UserID is replaced with the value "a****b" where a and b are random characters from the UserID.

When bidding on items listed on the Philippines site: UserID is replaced with the value "Bidder X" where X is a number indicating the order of that user's first bid. For example, if the user was the third bidder, UserID = Bidder 3. Note that in this Philippines site format, the anonymous bidder ID stays the same for a given auction, but is different for different auctions. For example, a bidder who is the third and then the seventh bidder in an auction will be listed for both bids as "Bidder 3". However, if that same bidder is the first bidder on a different auction, the bidder will be listed for that auction as "Bidder 1", not "Bidder 3".

For GetMyeBayBuying only, when bidding on items listed on the UK and AU sites: UserID is replaced with the string "High Bidder".

To find out the values included in the current listing, call GetItem and look through the ShippingDetails container in the response. For additional information, see Revise shipping details.
New users who list their first items in selected categories on the US site must specify at least one domestic shipping service. This applies to a category if GetCategoryFeatures returns true for Category.ShippingTermsRequired.

For multi-quantity, fixed-price listings, a seller can revise all shipping details of the listing (except for sales tax and for shipping type of Freight) for all unsold items. This applies to both domestic and international shipping. Checkout is not affected for those who bought items prior to the seller's shipping changes—the shipping details that were in effect at the time of purchase are used for that buyer at the time of checkout.

Shipping details are not applicable to any classified ad listings, as shipping/delivery/pickup is handled by the buyer and seller off of the eBay platform.

Note: To create a listing that is 'Local Pickup only' (buyer picks up, with no shipping/delivery available), the user does the following two things:
Either omit the entire ShippingDetails container, or pass in an empty ShippingDetails container - <ShippingDetails/>
Pass in one ShipToLocations field, with its value set to None - <ShipToLocations>None</ShipToLocations>

For GetMyeBayBuying, GetMyeBaySelling: ShippingDetails is not returned.

repeatable: [0..*]	Shipping costs and options related to an international shipping service. If used, at least one domestic shipping service must also be provided in ShippingServiceOptions.

If you specify multiple InternationalShippingServiceOption nodes, the repeating nodes must be contiguous. That is, you cannot insert other nodes between InternationalShippingServiceOption nodes.

All specified domestic and international shipping services must be the same shipping type (for example, Flat versus Calculated).

A seller can offer up to four domestic shipping services and up to five international shipping services. However, if the seller is opted in to the Global Shipping Program or eBay International Shipping, only four other international shipping services may be offered (regardless of whether or not Global Shipping or eBay International Shipping is offered for the listing).

If you specify ShippingDetails when you revise or relist an item but you omit InternationalShippingServiceOption, eBay will drop the international shipping services (except the Global Shipping Program or eBay International Shipping) from the listing. This may also have unintended side effects, as other fields that depend on this data may be dropped as well. To retain the shipping services and dependent fields when you modify other shipping details, it may be simplest to specify all ShippingDetails that you still want to include in the listing.

For GetItemShipping, results are filtered: if any service is not available in the buyer's region, it is removed. If no services remain after this filtering, a warning is returned.

  .ShippingServiceOptions	ShippingServiceOptionsType	Conditionally,
repeatable: [0..*]	This container is used to provide details on a specific domestic shipping service option, including the unique identifier of the shipping service option and the costs related to domestic shipping service. A separate ShippingServiceOptions container is needed for each domestic shipping service option that is available to ship the item. Unless a fulfillment business policy is being used, generally at least one ShippingServiceOptions container will be required.

If you specify multiple ShippingServiceOptions nodes, the repeating nodes must be contiguous. For example, you can insert InternationalShippingServiceOption nodes after a list of repeating ShippingServiceOptions nodes, but not between them:

<ShippingServiceOptions>...</ShippingServiceOptions>
<ShippingServiceOptions>...</ShippingServiceOptions>
<ShippingServiceOptions>...</ShippingServiceOptions>
<InternationalShippingServiceOption>...</InternationalShippingServiceOption>

All specified domestic and international shipping services must be the same shipping type (for example, Flat versus Calculated).

Note: If the seller has set the shipping cost model to 'Flat' or 'Calculated' (ShippingDetails.ShippingType field), at least one actual shipping service option must be specified through a ShippingServiceOptions container. In the past, eBay allowed users to set the shipping cost model to 'Flat' or 'Calculated', and then just pass in one ShippingServiceOptions container with the ShippingServiceOptions.ShipppingService value set to a 'Local Pickup' option. Now, sellers must pass in at least one actual domestic shipping service option in addition to any 'Local Pickup' option, or the listing will be blocked with the following error: 17510 - You must specify at least one domestic shipping service, other than or in addition to Local Pickup.

If 'free shipping' is for any other shipping service, this field is ignored.

For 'Get' calls, including GetItem, this field is only returned if 1.
Note: If a seller is specifying a shipping service option as 'free shipping', in addition to this FreeShipping boolean field, the seller will also need to include the corresponding ShippingServiceCost field and set its value to 0.0, as eBay will not do this automatically.
Note: If the condition is certified refurbished (ConditionID set to 2000, 'Certified - Refurbished'), you must offer a free shipping option. Set FreeShipping as true (or 1) along with the ShippingServiceCost as 0.0 for the first domestic shipping service.

For a list of valid ShippingService values, call GeteBayDetails with DetailName set to ShippingServiceDetails. The ShippingServiceDetails.ValidForSellingFlow flag must also be present. Otherwise, that particular shipping service option is no longer valid and cannot be offered to buyers through a listing.

To view the full list of domestic shipping service options in the response, look for the ShippingServiceDetails.ShippingService fields. Domestic shipping service options will not have a InternationalService = true field, as this indicates that the ShippingService value is an International shipping service option.

In the case of a multiple-quantity, fixed-price listing, the ShippingServiceAdditionalCost field also becomes applicable, and shows the cost to ship each additional unit of the item if the buyer purchases multiple quantity of the same line item.

Note: If the corresponding shipping service option is set as a 'free shipping' option (FreeShipping set to true) and flat-rate shipping is being used domestically (ShippingType is set to Flat or FlatDomesticCalculatedInternational), the seller must still include this ShippingServiceCost field and set its value to 0.0, as eBay will not do this automatically. Do not include ShippingServiceCost when the domestic shipping service option is set to represent domestic calculated shipping (ShippingType is set to Calculated or CalculatedDomesticFlatInternational), as error 10019 occurs.

For example, the listing site can affect the validation of Category in listing requests, international business seller requirements, the values of converted (localized) prices in responses, the item-related time stamps that are displayed on the eBay site, the visibility of the item in some types of searches (e.g., GetCategoryListings), and other information. In some cases, the rules are determined by a combination of the site, the user's registration address, and other information. You cannot change the site when you revise a listing.

For auction listings: Competitive bidding starts at this value. Once at least one bid has been placed, StartPrice remains the same but CurrentPrice is incremented to the amount of each succeeding bid. If ReservePrice is also specified, the value of StartPrice must be lower than the value of ReservePrice.

For input on fixed-price listings (FixedPriceItem): This is the constant price at which a buyer may purchase the item.

GetMyeBaySelling does not return Item.StartPrice for fixed price items—it returns Item.SellingStatus.CurrentPrice.

For AddFixedPriceItem and VerifyAddFixedPriceItem: Required when no variations are specified. If variations are specified, use Variation.StartPrice for each variation instead.

For Revise calls: If the StartPrice value for a fixed-price item is changed with a Revise call, the MinimumBestOfferPrice and BestOfferAutoAcceptPrice fields in the ListingDetails container will be dropped (if set), basically turning off the Best Offer Auto Accept and/or Auto Decline features. If the seller wanted to reintroduce either of these Best Offer threshold values in the listing again, an additional Revise call would have to be made, passing in the desired threshold values.

Note: For the US site, new eBay sellers are subject to Seller Limits, which limit the quantity of items that may be listed and/or the total cumulative value of these listings. While subject to these selling limits, an eBay seller can use the GetMyeBaySelling call to retrieve both the remaining number of listings they can create and the remaining cumulative value of these listings. These values are shown in the Summary.QuantityLimitRemaining and Summary.AmountLimitRemaining fields in the GetMyeBaySelling response. If a call to add an item or revise an item would result in the exceeding of these limits, the add item or revise item call will fail. These fields will only be returned if the seller is subject to seller limits.

These values are shown in the Summary.QuantityLimitRemaining and Summary.AmountLimitRemaining fields in the GetMyeBaySelling response. If a call to add an item or revise an item would result in the exceeding of these limits, the add item or revise item call will fail.

  .Item.Variations	VariationsType	Conditionally	
Variations are similar (but not identical) items in a multiple-variation, fixed-price listing. For example, a T-shirt listing could contain multiple items of the same brand that vary by color and size (like "Blue, Large" and "Black, Medium"). Each variation specifies a combination of one of these colors and sizes. Each variation can have a different quantity and price. You can buy multiple items from one variation at the same time. (That is, one order line item can contain multiple items from a single variation.)

If you list in two categories, both categories must support listing with variations. See VariationsEnabled in GetCategoryFeatures to determine applicable categories.

For ReviseFixedPriceItem and RelistFixedPriceItem: Once a listing has been submitted with variations, you can't delete all the variations when you revise or relist the listing (because it would be considered a different listing). You also can't add or change variation specifics (because they are unique identifiers). However, you can delete or replace individual variations as needed to match your current inventory. If a variation has no purchases, use the Variation.Delete field to delete the variation. If it has inventory, set the Quantity to 0.

As a best practice, if you want to revise multiple variations in the same listing at the same time (i.e., within a very short period), use a single ReviseFixedPriceItem request and include all the variation revisions in the same request. If your application design requires you to revise each variation individually, then avoid using multiple parallel threads. Instead, use a serial, synchronous process. That is, wait until each revision has been processed by eBay before submitting the next revision request for another variation in the same listing.

For GetItem and related calls Only returned when a listing has variations.

For GetSellerList: Only returned when a listing has variations, IncludeVariations was set to true in the request, the DetailLevel was set to ReturnAll, and an applicable pagination value and time range were specified.

For GetItemTransactions Only returned in Item when a listing has variations and IncludeVariations was set to true in the request. (Also see Variation returned in Transaction for information about which variation was actually purchased.)

For GetSellerEvents, GetMyeBayBuying, and GetMyeBaySelling: Only returned when a listing has variations and HideVariations was set to false or not specified in the request.
Note: This container will stop being returned in GetItemTransactions on January 31, 2024.

  .Item.Variations.Variation	VariationType	Conditionally,
repeatable: [0..*]	
Contains data that distinguishes one item variation from another. For example, if an item varies by color and size, each Variation node specifies a combination of one of those colors and sizes.

When listing or relisting an item, you are allowed to create a listing with only one item variation, and you might have a plan to add more item variations to the listing in the future. However, if you don't plan to add other item variations in the future, we recommend that you avoid listing with only one variation, so that you avoid confusing buyers.

If you specify multiple Variation containers in an add/revise/relist/verify add call to define multiple item variations, the Variation containers must be contiguous or an error will occur. This means that you would not want to input a Pictures or a VariationSpecificsSet container in between Variation containers in an API call.

When you modify an item variation with a ReviseFixedPriceItem call, the best practice is to include all applicable fields under the Variation container, even if some of the values/settings are not being modified. The StartPrice and VariationSpecifics must be included when modifying an existing item variation, even if these values are not being changed. If a SKU value is defined for the item variation, it is strongly recommended that you include the SKU field, regardless of whether the SKU value is changing or not. If the SKU field is not included, any existing SKU value will be removed from the item variation. It is also strongly recommended that you include the Quantity field and input an accurate value, because if the Quantity field is omitted in the API call, the quantity for the item variation is set to 0.
Note: The Item.Variations container and its child fields will stop being returned in GetItemTransactions on January 31, 2024.

  .Item.Variations.Variation
  .VariationSpecifics	NameValueListArrayType	Conditionally,
repeatable: [2..5]	
A list of name/value pairs that uniquely identify the variation within the listing. All variations must specify the same set of Item Specific names, but each variation must provide a unique combination of values for those Item Specific names. For example, if the items vary by color and size, then every variation must specify 'Color' and 'Size' as Item Specific names, but no two variations can specify the same combination of 'Color' and 'Size' values.

When you revise a listing that includes variations, you can change names of Variationpecifics by using the Variations.ModifyNameList container. You can also add, delete, or replace individual variations as needed to match your current inventory. Use the Variation.Delete field to delete a variation that has no sales (order line items). If the variation has sales, then set the Quantity to 0.

For GetSellerEvents To keep the GetSellerEvents response smaller, Variationpecifics are not returned if the variation has a SKU. If the variation has no SKU, then Variationpecifics are returned instead. Optionally, you can pass IncludeVariationSpecifics as true in the request to force Variationpecifics to be returned, even when the SKU is returned.

If the listing has variations, any name that you use in the VariationSpecifics and VariationSpecificsSet nodes can't be used in the ItemSpecifics node.
When you list with Item Variations:
Specify shared Item Specifics (e.g., Brand) in the ItemSpecifics node.
Specify up to five VariationSpecifics in each Variation node.
Specify all applicable names with all their supported values in the VariationSpecificSet node.
See the Variation sample in the AddFixedPriceItem call reference for examples.

For PlaceOffer: Required if the item being purchased includes Item Variations.

For AddToWatchList and RemoveFromWatchList: The ItemID value of the multiple-variation listing and the name-value pair to identify each variation in the listing are required.

Note: As of August 30, 2018, California will require sellers to display a Proposition 65 warning on online retail sites if products contain chemicals and/or substances that may impact the health of California buyers. This requirement is applicable to most eBay US categories, including eBay Motors, Motors Parts & Accessories, and catalog-enabled categories. The warning message can be customized by the seller, but should contain the following basic information:
The name of at least one listed chemical that prompted the warning
Text stating that the product 'can expose you to' the chemical(s) in the product
The URL for OEHHA's new Proposition 65 warnings website, which is www.P65Warnings.ca.gov
Unlike standard item specifics that allow a maximum of 65 characters in the Value field, the matching value for the 'California Prop 65 Warning' item specific allows up to 800 characters of text. When a seller passes in this item specific, eBay will automatically insert a warning symbol icon for the listing.

  .NameValueList.Name	string	Conditionally	Depending on the call and context, this value is either a name of an Item/Variation Specific, or a Parts Compatibility name.

For the AddItem and AddFixedPriceItem families of calls: In the Item.ItemSpecifics context, the value in this field will either be the name of a required/recommended/optional item specific name for the category, or it may be a seller's customized item specific name.

For the AddFixedPriceItem family of calls: In the Compatibility.NameValueList context, this value is a motor vehicle aspect such as Year, Make, and Model. A Compatibility.NameValueList container is applicable for motor vehicle parts and accessories listings.

For PlaceOffer: Required if the line item being purchased is an item variation within a multiple-variation listing.

Note: For required and recommended item specifics that are returned in the getItemAspectsForCategory method of the Taxonomy API, the seller should pass in the name of these item specifics just as they are shown in the getItemAspectsForCategory response. Similarly, for catalog-enabled categories, the seller should pass in the name of instance aspects just as they are shown in the getItemAspectsForCategory response. Instance aspects are additional details unique to a specific item or listing that a seller can include along with the product aspects that are already defined in the eBay catalog product associated with the listing. Instance aspects common to many catalog-enabled categories include 'Bundle Description' and 'Modification Description'. eBay US sellers who ship to California are required to pass in a 'California Prop 65 Warning' item specific if the item in the listing contains one or more chemicals known to be harmful to human health. This item specific is passed at the listing level for both single-variation and multiple-variation listings. The 'California Prop 65 Warning' is considered an instance specific because it will be retained on the listing even when the seller lists using an eBay catalog product. The 'California Prop 65 Warning' may be applicable in most eBay US categories, including eBay Motors, Motors Parts & Accessories, and catalog-enabled categories.
Note: If Brand and MPN (Manufacturer Part Number) are being used to identify product variations in a multiple-variation listing, the Brand must be specified at the item level (ItemSpecifics container) and the MPN for each product variation must be specified at the variation level (VariationSpecifics container). The Brand name must be the same for all variations within a single listing.

For the AddItem family of calls: Multiple values can only be specified for an Item Specific if the itemToAspectCardinality field of the getItemAspectsForCategory method shows a value of MULTI. If an item specific only supports a single value, only the first item specific value specified in the request will be used.

For the Compatibility.NameValueList context, this is the corresponding value of a motor vehicle aspect such as Year, Make, and Model. A Compatibility.NameValueList container is applicable for motor vehicle parts and accessories listings.

For PlaceOffer: Required if the line item being purchased is an item variation within a multiple-variation listing.

Note: The standard maximum length for the value of an item specific is 65, but the maximum allowed length increases for instance aspects such as 'Bundle Description' and 'Modification Description'. For item specifics with max lengths greater than 65, the actual max length will be returned in a corresponding aspectMaxLength field. The maximum allowed length for the new 'California Prop 65 Warning' item specific is 800 characters. For more information about the 'California Prop 65 Warning' item specific, see the ItemSpecifics.NameValueList field description.

An ItemID/TransactionID pair can be used and referenced during an order checkout flow to identify a line item.

The TransactionID value for auction listings is always 0 since there can be only one winning bidder/one sale for an auction listing.

Note: Historically, TransactionID values have been '0' for auction listings, and some developers may have built logic around this. However, non-zero TransactionID values for auction listings started being used for some eBay marketplaces beginning in July 2024, and all eBay marketplaces are expected to start using non-zero TransactionID values for auction listings in the near future. If necessary, developers should update code to handle non-zero transaction IDs for auction transactions.

For GetOrders and GetItemTransactions only: If using Trading WSDL Version 1019 or above, this field will only be returned to the buyer and seller, and no longer returned at all to third parties. If using a Trading WSDL older than Version 1019, transaction ID is only returned to the buyer and seller, and a dummy value of 10000000000000 will be returned to all third parties.

  .Item.Seller.Email	string	Conditionally	Email address for the user. Please see the links below to the topics related to anonymous user information and static email addresses. You cannot retrieve an email address for any user with whom you do not have an order relationship, regardless of site.

An email address of another user is only returned if you and the other user are in an order relationship, within a certain time of order line item creation (although this limitation isn't applicable to the GetAllBidders call in the case of motor vehicles categories.) Based on Trust and Safety policies, the time is unspecified and can vary by site.

Since a bidder's user info is anonymous, this tag will be returned only to that bidder, and to the seller of an item that the user is bidding on.

For the GetOrders call, the buyer's email address will be returned (to the seller only) for orders less than two weeks old, but for orders that occurred more than two weeks in the past, the buyer's email address will no longer be returned. This Email field will still be returned, but 'dummy data', such as Invalid Request will replace the actual email address.

Note: For the GetItemTransactions call, this field is only returned to the seller of the order; this field is not returned for the buyer or third party.

  .Item.Seller.UserID	UserIDType (string)	Conditionally	Unique eBay user ID for the user.

Note: Effective September 26, 2025, select developers will no longer receive username data for U.S. users through this field. Instead, an immutable user ID will be returned in its place. For more information, please refer to Data Handling Compliance.

Since a bidder's user info is anonymous, this tag contains the actual value of an ID only for that bidder, and for the seller of an item that the user is bidding on. For other users, the actual value is replaced by an anonymous value, according to these rules:

When bidding on items, UserID is replaced with the value "a****b" where a and b are random characters from the UserID. For example, if the UserID = IBidALot, it might be displayed as, "I****A".

Important: In this format, the anonymous bidder ID can change for each auction.
For GetMyeBayBuying only, when bidding on items: UserID is replaced with the value "a****b" where a and b are random characters from the UserID.

When bidding on items listed on the Philippines site: UserID is replaced with the value "Bidder X" where X is a number indicating the order of that user's first bid. For example, if the user was the third bidder, UserID = Bidder 3. Note that in this Philippines site format, the anonymous bidder ID stays the same for a given auction, but is different for different auctions. For example, a bidder who is the third and then the seventh bidder in an auction will be listed for both bids as "Bidder 3". However, if that same bidder is the first bidder on a different auction, the bidder will be listed for that auction as "Bidder 1", not "Bidder 3".

For GetMyeBayBuying only, when bidding on items listed on the UK and AU sites: UserID is replaced with the string "High Bidder".

  .Item.ShippingDetails	ShippingDetailsType	Conditionally	The shipping-related details for an order, including flat and calculated shipping costs.

Note: For sellers who are using a shipping (aka Fulfillment) business policy to create/revise/relist an item, none of the fields under the ShippingDetails container are necessary. A fulfillment business policy can be set up and/or modified in My eBay, or via the Account API. A fulfillment business policy is associated to a listing through the Item.SellerProfiles.SellerShippingProfile container.

If you do not use a fulfillment business policy, many of the fields under this ShippingDetails container become required in your request.
Note: For ReviseItem and ReviseFixedPriceItem calls: If you are updating any field under the ShippingDetails container, you must include all containers and fields set under this container even if their values are not changing. If you do not do this, some fields may be removed from the listing. To find out the values included in the current listing, call GetItem and look through the ShippingDetails container in the response. For additional information, see Revise shipping details.
New users who list their first items in selected categories on the US site must specify at least one domestic shipping service. This applies to a category if GetCategoryFeatures returns true for Category.ShippingTermsRequired.

For multi-quantity, fixed-price listings, a seller can revise all shipping details of the listing (except for sales tax and for shipping type of Freight) for all unsold items. This applies to both domestic and international shipping. Checkout is not affected for those who bought items prior to the seller's shipping changes—the shipping details that were in effect at the time of purchase are used for that buyer at the time of checkout.

Shipping details are not applicable to any classified ad listings, as shipping/delivery/pickup is handled by the buyer and seller off of the eBay platform.

Note: To create a listing that is 'Local Pickup only' (buyer picks up, with no shipping/delivery available), the user does the following two things:
Either omit the entire ShippingDetails container, or pass in an empty ShippingDetails container - <ShippingDetails/>
Pass in one ShipToLocations field, with its value set to None - <ShipToLocations>None</ShipToLocations>

For GetMyeBayBuying, GetMyeBaySelling: ShippingDetails is not returned.

  .InternationalShippingServiceOption	InternationalShippingServiceOptionsType	Conditionally,
repeatable: [0..*]	Shipping costs and options related to an international shipping service. If used, at least one domestic shipping service must also be provided in ShippingServiceOptions.

If you specify multiple InternationalShippingServiceOption nodes, the repeating nodes must be contiguous. That is, you cannot insert other nodes between InternationalShippingServiceOption nodes.

All specified domestic and international shipping services must be the same shipping type (for example, Flat versus Calculated).

A seller can offer up to four domestic shipping services and up to five international shipping services. However, if the seller is opted in to the Global Shipping Program or eBay International Shipping, only four other international shipping services may be offered (regardless of whether or not Global Shipping or eBay International Shipping is offered for the listing).

If you specify ShippingDetails when you revise or relist an item but you omit InternationalShippingServiceOption, eBay will drop the international shipping services (except the Global Shipping Program or eBay International Shipping) from the listing. This may also have unintended side effects, as other fields that depend on this data may be dropped as well. To retain the shipping services and dependent fields when you modify other shipping details, it may be simplest to specify all ShippingDetails that you still want to include in the listing.

For GetItemShipping, results are filtered: if any service is not available in the buyer's region, it is removed. If no services remain after this filtering, a warning is returned.

  .ShippingServiceOptions	ShippingServiceOptionsType	Conditionally,
repeatable: [0..*]	This container is used to provide details on a specific domestic shipping service option, including the unique identifier of the shipping service option and the costs related to domestic shipping service. A separate ShippingServiceOptions container is needed for each domestic shipping service option that is available to ship the item. Unless a fulfillment business policy is being used, generally at least one ShippingServiceOptions container will be required.

If you specify multiple ShippingServiceOptions nodes, the repeating nodes must be contiguous. For example, you can insert InternationalShippingServiceOption nodes after a list of repeating ShippingServiceOptions nodes, but not between them:

<ShippingServiceOptions>...</ShippingServiceOptions>
<ShippingServiceOptions>...</ShippingServiceOptions>
<ShippingServiceOptions>...</ShippingServiceOptions>
<InternationalShippingServiceOption>...</InternationalShippingServiceOption>
<InternationalShippingServiceOption>...</InternationalShippingServiceOption>

If you specify ShippingDetails when you revise or relist an item but you omit ShippingServiceOptions, eBay will drop the domestic shipping services from the listing. This may also have unintended side effects, as other fields that depend on this data may be dropped as well.

To retain the shipping services and dependent fields when you modify other shipping details, it may be simplest to specify all ShippingDetails that you still want to include in the listing.

A seller can offer up to four domestic shipping services and up to five international shipping services. However, if the seller is opted in to the Global Shipping Program or eBay International Shipping, only four other international shipping services may be offered (regardless of whether or not Global Shipping shipment or eBay International Shipping is offered for the listing). All specified domestic and international shipping services must be the same shipping type (for example, Flat versus Calculated).

Note: If the seller has set the shipping cost model to 'Flat' or 'Calculated' (ShippingDetails.ShippingType field), at least one actual shipping service option must be specified through a ShippingServiceOptions container. In the past, eBay allowed users to set the shipping cost model to 'Flat' or 'Calculated', and then just pass in one ShippingServiceOptions container with the ShippingServiceOptions.ShipppingService value set to a 'Local Pickup' option. Now, sellers must pass in at least one actual domestic shipping service option in addition to any 'Local Pickup' option, or the listing will be blocked with the following error: 17510 - You must specify at least one domestic shipping service, other than or in addition to Local Pickup.

For GetItemShipping, results are filtered: if any service is not available in the buyer's region, it is removed. If no services remain after this filtering, a warning is returned.

If 'free shipping' is for any other shipping service, this field is ignored.

For 'Get' calls, including GetItem, this field is only returned if 1.
Note: If a seller is specifying a shipping service option as 'free shipping', in addition to this FreeShipping boolean field, the seller will also need to include the corresponding ShippingServiceCost field and set its value to 0.0, as eBay will not do this automatically.
Note: If the condition is certified refurbished (ConditionID set to 2000, 'Certified - Refurbished'), you must offer a free shipping option. Set FreeShipping as true (or 1) along with the ShippingServiceCost as 0.0 for the first domestic shipping service.

For a list of valid ShippingService values, call GeteBayDetails with DetailName set to ShippingServiceDetails. The ShippingServiceDetails.ValidForSellingFlow flag must also be present. Otherwise, that particular shipping service option is no longer valid and cannot be offered to buyers through a listing.

To view the full list of domestic shipping service options in the response, look for the ShippingServiceDetails.ShippingService fields. Domestic shipping service options will not have a InternationalService = true field, as this indicates that the ShippingService value is an International shipping service option.

Note: If the corresponding shipping service option is set as a 'free shipping' option (FreeShipping set to true) and flat-rate shipping is being used domestically (ShippingType is set to Flat or FlatDomesticCalculatedInternational), the seller must still include this ShippingServiceCost field and set its value to 0.0, as eBay will not do this automatically.

  .Item.StartPrice	AmountType (double)	Conditionally	The original price of the item at listing or re-listing time. If this value changes when the item is revised, the new value becomes the original price.

For auction listings: Competitive bidding starts at this value. Once at least one bid has been placed, StartPrice remains the same but CurrentPrice is incremented to the amount of each succeeding bid. If ReservePrice is also specified, the value of StartPrice must be lower than the value of ReservePrice.

For input on fixed-price listings (FixedPriceItem): This is the constant price at which a buyer may purchase the item.

GetMyeBaySelling does not return Item.StartPrice for fixed price items—it returns Item.SellingStatus.CurrentPrice.

For AddFixedPriceItem and VerifyAddFixedPriceItem: Required when no variations are specified. If variations are specified, use Variation.StartPrice for each variation instead.

For Revise calls: If the StartPrice value for a fixed-price item is changed with a Revise call, the MinimumBestOfferPrice and BestOfferAutoAcceptPrice fields in the ListingDetails container will be dropped (if set), basically turning off the Best Offer Auto Accept and/or Auto Decline features. If the seller wanted to reintroduce either of these Best Offer threshold values in the listing again, an additional Revise call would have to be made, passing in the desired threshold values.

Note: For the US site, new eBay sellers are subject to Seller Limits, which limit the quantity of items that may be listed and/or the total cumulative value of these listings. While subject to these selling limits, an eBay seller can use the GetMyeBaySelling call to retrieve both the remaining number of listings they can create and the remaining cumulative value of these listings. These values are shown in the Summary.QuantityLimitRemaining and Summary.AmountLimitRemaining fields in the GetMyeBaySelling response. If a call to add an item or revise an item would result in the exceeding of these limits, the add item or revise item call will fail. These fields will only be returned if the seller is subject to seller limits.

  .Item.Variations	VariationsType	Conditionally	
Variations are similar (but not identical) items in a multiple-variation, fixed-price listing. For example, a T-shirt listing could contain multiple items of the same brand that vary by color and size (like "Blue, Large" and "Black, Medium"). Each variation specifies a combination of one of these colors and sizes. Each variation can have a different quantity and price. You can buy multiple items from one variation at the same time. (That is, one order line item can contain multiple items from a single variation.)

If you list in two categories, both categories must support listing with variations. See VariationsEnabled in GetCategoryFeatures to determine applicable categories.

For ReviseFixedPriceItem and RelistFixedPriceItem: Once a listing has been submitted with variations, you can't delete all the variations when you revise or relist the listing (because it would be considered a different listing). You also can't add or change variation specifics (because they are unique identifiers). However, you can delete or replace individual variations as needed to match your current inventory. If a variation has no purchases, use the Variation.Delete field to delete the variation. If it has inventory, set the Quantity to 0.

As a best practice, if you want to revise multiple variations in the same listing at the same time (i.e., within a very short period), use a single ReviseFixedPriceItem request and include all the variation revisions in the same request. If your application design requires you to revise each variation individually, then avoid using multiple parallel threads. Instead, use a serial, synchronous process. That is, wait until each revision has been processed by eBay before submitting the next revision request for another variation in the same listing.

For GetItem and related calls Only returned when a listing has variations.

For GetSellerList: Only returned when a listing has variations, IncludeVariations was set to true in the request, the DetailLevel was set to ReturnAll, and an applicable pagination value and time range were specified.

For GetItemTransactions Only returned in Item when a listing has variations and IncludeVariations was set to true in the request. (Also see Variation returned in Transaction for information about which variation was actually purchased.)

For GetSellerEvents, GetMyeBayBuying, and GetMyeBaySelling: Only returned when a listing has variations and HideVariations was set to false or not specified in the request.
Note: This container will stop being returned in GetItemTransactions on January 31, 2024.

WonList.OrderTransactionArray
  .OrderTransaction.Transaction
  .Item.Variations.Variation	VariationType	Conditionally,
repeatable: [0..*]	
Contains data that distinguishes one item variation from another. For example, if an item varies by color and size, each Variation node specifies a combination of one of those colors and sizes.

When listing or relisting an item, you are allowed to create a listing with only one item variation, and you might have a plan to add more item variations to the listing in the future. However, if you don't plan to add other item variations in the future, we recommend that you avoid listing with only one variation, so that you avoid confusing buyers.

If you specify multiple Variation containers in an add/revise/relist/verify add call to define multiple item variations, the Variation containers must be contiguous or an error will occur. This means that you would not want to input a Pictures or a VariationSpecificsSet container in between Variation containers in an API call.

When you modify an item variation with a ReviseFixedPriceItem call, the best practice is to include all applicable fields under the Variation container, even if some of the values/settings are not being modified. The StartPrice and VariationSpecifics must be included when modifying an existing item variation, even if these values are not being changed. If a SKU value is defined for the item variation, it is strongly recommended that you include the SKU field, regardless of whether the SKU value is changing or not. If the SKU field is not included, any existing SKU value will be removed from the item variation. It is also strongly recommended that you include the Quantity field and input an accurate value, because if the Quantity field is omitted in the API call, the quantity for the item variation is set to 0.
Note: The Item.Variations container and its child fields will stop being returned in GetItemTransactions on January 31, 2024.

  .Item.Variations.Variation
  .VariationSpecifics	NameValueListArrayType	Conditionally,
repeatable: [2..5]	
A list of name/value pairs that uniquely identify the variation within the listing. All variations must specify the same set of Item Specific names, but each variation must provide a unique combination of values for those Item Specific names. For example, if the items vary by color and size, then every variation must specify 'Color' and 'Size' as Item Specific names, but no two variations can specify the same combination of 'Color' and 'Size' values.

When you revise a listing that includes variations, you can change names of Variationpecifics by using the Variations.ModifyNameList container. You can also add, delete, or replace individual variations as needed to match your current inventory. Use the Variation.Delete field to delete a variation that has no sales (order line items). If the variation has sales, then set the Quantity to 0.

For GetSellerEvents To keep the GetSellerEvents response smaller, Variationpecifics are not returned if the variation has a SKU. If the variation has no SKU, then Variationpecifics are returned instead. Optionally, you can pass IncludeVariationSpecifics as true in the request to force Variationpecifics to be returned, even when the SKU is returned.
Note: The Item.Variations container and its child fields will stop being returned in GetItemTransactions on January 31, 2024.

For the AddFixedPriceItem family of calls: The same NameValueList schema is used for the ItemSpecifics node, the VariationSpecifics node, and the VariationSpecifcsSet node.

If the listing has variations, any name that you use in the VariationSpecifics and VariationSpecificsSet nodes can't be used in the ItemSpecifics node.
When you list with Item Variations:
Specify shared Item Specifics (e.g., Brand) in the ItemSpecifics node.
Specify up to five VariationSpecifics in each Variation node.
Specify all applicable names with all their supported values in the VariationSpecificSet node.
See the Variation sample in the AddFixedPriceItem call reference for examples.

For PlaceOffer: Required if the item being purchased includes Item Variations.

For AddToWatchList and RemoveFromWatchList: The ItemID value of the multiple-variation listing and the name-value pair to identify each variation in the listing are required.

Note: As of August 30, 2018, California will require sellers to display a Proposition 65 warning on online retail sites if products contain chemicals and/or substances that may impact the health of California buyers. This requirement is applicable to most eBay US categories, including eBay Motors, Motors Parts & Accessories, and catalog-enabled categories. The warning message can be customized by the seller, but should contain the following basic information:
The name of at least one listed chemical that prompted the warning
Text stating that the product 'can expose you to' the chemical(s) in the product
The URL for OEHHA's new Proposition 65 warnings website, which is www.P65Warnings.ca.gov
Unlike standard item specifics that allow a maximum of 65 characters in the Value field, the matching value for the 'California Prop 65 Warning' item specific allows up to 800 characters of text. When a seller passes in this item specific, eBay will automatically insert a warning symbol icon for the listing.

  .NameValueList.Name	string	Conditionally	Depending on the call and context, this value is either a name of an Item/Variation Specific, or a Parts Compatibility name.

For the AddItem and AddFixedPriceItem families of calls: In the Item.ItemSpecifics context, the value in this field will either be the name of a required/recommended/optional item specific name for the category, or it may be a seller's customized item specific name.

For the AddFixedPriceItem family of calls: In the Compatibility.NameValueList context, this value is a motor vehicle aspect such as Year, Make, and Model. A Compatibility.NameValueList container is applicable for motor vehicle parts and accessories listings.

For PlaceOffer: Required if the line item being purchased is an item variation within a multiple-variation listing.

Note: For required and recommended item specifics that are returned in the getItemAspectsForCategory method of the Taxonomy API, the seller should pass in the name of these item specifics just as they are shown in the getItemAspectsForCategory response. Similarly, for catalog-enabled categories, the seller should pass in the name of instance aspects just as they are shown in the getItemAspectsForCategory response. Instance aspects are additional details unique to a specific item or listing that a seller can include along with the product aspects that are already defined in the eBay catalog product associated with the listing. Instance aspects common to many catalog-enabled categories include 'Bundle Description' and 'Modification Description'. eBay US sellers who ship to California are required to pass in a 'California Prop 65 Warning' item specific if the item in the listing contains one or more chemicals known to be harmful to human health. This item specific is passed at the listing level for both single-variation and multiple-variation listings. The 'California Prop 65 Warning' is considered an instance specific because it will be retained on the listing even when the seller lists using an eBay catalog product. The 'California Prop 65 Warning' may be applicable in most eBay US categories, including eBay Motors, Motors Parts & Accessories, and catalog-enabled categories.
Note: If Brand and MPN (Manufacturer Part Number) are being used to identify product variations in a multiple-variation listing, the Brand must be specified at the item level (ItemSpecifics container) and the MPN for each product variation must be specified at the variation level (VariationSpecifics container). The Brand name must be the same for all variations within a single listing.

For the AddItem family of calls: Multiple values can only be specified for an Item Specific if the itemToAspectCardinality field of the getItemAspectsForCategory method shows a value of MULTI. If an item specific only supports a single value, only the first item specific value specified in the request will be used.

For the Compatibility.NameValueList context, this is the corresponding value of a motor vehicle aspect such as Year, Make, and Model. A Compatibility.NameValueList container is applicable for motor vehicle parts and accessories listings.

For PlaceOffer: Required if the line item being purchased is an item variation within a multiple-variation listing.

Note: The standard maximum length for the value of an item specific is 65, but the maximum allowed length increases for instance aspects such as 'Bundle Description' and 'Modification Description'. For item specifics with max lengths greater than 65, the actual max length will be returned in a corresponding aspectMaxLength field. The maximum allowed length for the new 'California Prop 65 Warning' item specific is 800 characters.

If multiple units were purchased through a non- variation, fixed-price listing, this value will reflect that. So, if the base cost of the order line item was $15.00, and a quantity of two were purchased (Transaction.QuantityPurchased) the value in this field would show as 30.00.

To see the full price of the order line item, including any shipping and handling charges, and any sales tax, the (Transaction.TotalPrice) field value should be viewed instead. However, note that the TotalPrice field value is only updated after a shipping service option is selected and payment is made. And if the seller is offering free shipping, the values in the TotalTransactionPrice and the TotalPrice fields may be the same.

DetailLevel: ReturnAll. Also returned if DetailLevel is not provided on input.
WonList.OrderTransactionArray

  .TotalTransactionPrice
  [ attribute currencyID ]	CurrencyCodeType	Conditionally	The sale price of the order line item. This amount does not take into account shipping and handling charges, sales tax, or any other costs related to the order line item. If multiple units were purchased through a non- variation, fixed-price listing, this value will reflect that. So, if the base cost of the order line item was $15.00, and a quantity of two were purchased (Transaction.QuantityPurchased) the value in this field would show as 30.00.

And if the seller is offering free shipping, the values in the TotalTransactionPrice and the TotalPrice fields may be the same.

For a list of possible enumeration values, see CurrencyCodeType.
WonList.OrderTransactionArray
  .OrderTransaction.Transaction
  .TransactionID	string	Conditionally	Unique identifier for an eBay sales transaction. This identifier is created once there is a commitment from a buyer to purchase an item, or if/when the buyer actually purchases the line item through a 'Buy it Now' option. An ItemID/TransactionID pair can be used and referenced during an order checkout flow to identify a line item.

The TransactionID value for auction listings is always 0 since there can be only one winning bidder/one sale for an auction listing.

Note: Historically, TransactionID values have been '0' for auction listings, and some developers may have built logic around this. However, non-zero TransactionID values for auction listings started being used for some eBay marketplaces beginning in July 2024, and all eBay marketplaces are expected to start using non-zero TransactionID values for auction listings in the near future. If necessary, developers should update code to handle non-zero transaction IDs for auction transactions.

For GetOrders and GetItemTransactions only: If using Trading WSDL Version 1019 or above, this field will only be returned to the buyer and seller, and no longer returned at all to third parties. If using a Trading WSDL older than Version 1019, transaction ID is only returned to the buyer and seller, and a dummy value of 10000000000000 will be returned to all third parties.

DetailLevel: ReturnAll. Also returned if DetailLevel is not provided on input.
WonList.PaginationResult	PaginationResultType	Conditionally	Specifies information about the list, including number of pages and number of entries.

DetailLevel: ReturnAll. Also returned if DetailLevel is not provided on input.
WonList.PaginationResult
  .TotalNumberOfEntries	int	Conditionally	Indicates the total number of entries that could be returned by repeated call requests. Returned with a value of 0 if no entries are available.
WonList.PaginationResult
  .TotalNumberOfPages	int	Conditionally	Indicates the total number of pages of data that could be returned by repeated requests. Returned with a value of 0 if no pages are available.
Standard Output Fields  
Ack	AckCodeType	Always	A token representing the application-level acknowledgement code that indicates the response status (e.g., success). The AckCodeType list specifies the possible values for the Ack field.

Applicable values:

CustomCode
(out) Reserved for internal or future use.
Failure
(out) This value indicates that the call request processing failed.
Success
(out) This value indicates that the call request was processed successfully without any issues.
Warning
(out) This value indicates that the call request was successful, but processing was not without any issues. These issues can be checked in the Errors container, that will also be returned when one or more known issues occur with the call request.

(Not all values in AckCodeType apply to this field.)

Code so that your app gracefully handles any future changes to this list.
Build	string	Always	This refers to the specific software build that eBay used when processing the request and generating the response. This includes the version number plus additional information. eBay Developer Support may request the build information when helping you resolve technical issues.
CorrelationID	string	Conditionally	Most Trading API calls support a MessageID element in the request and a CorrelationID element in the response. If you pass in a MessageID in a request, the same value will be returned in the CorrelationID field in the response. Pairing these values can help you track and confirm that a response is returned for every request and to match specific responses to specific requests. If you do not pass a MessageID value in the request, CorrelationID is not returned.

Note: GetCategories is designed to retrieve very large sets of metadata that change once a day or less often. To improve performance, these calls return cached responses when you request all available data (with no filters). When this occurs, the MessageID and CorrelationID fields aren't applicable. However, if you specify an input filter to reduce the amount of data returned, the calls retrieve the latest data (not cached). When this occurs, MessageID and CorrelationID are applicable.
Errors	ErrorType	Conditionally,
repeatable: [0..*]	A list of application-level errors (if any) that occurred when eBay processed the request.
Errors.ErrorClassification	ErrorClassificationCodeType	Conditionally	API errors are divided between two classes: system errors and request errors.

Applicable values:

CustomCode
(out) Reserved for internal or future use.
RequestError
(out) An error has occurred either as a result of a problem in the sending application or because the application's end-user has attempted to submit invalid data (or missing data). In these cases, do not retry the request. The problem must be corrected before the request can be made again. If the problem is due to something in the application (such as a missing required field), the application must be changed. If the problem is a result of end-user data, the application must alert the end-user to the problem and provide the means for the end-user to correct the data. Once the problem in the application or data is resolved, resend the request to eBay with the corrected data.
SystemError
(out) Indicates that an error has occurred on the eBay system side, such as a database or server down. An application can retry the request as-is a reasonable number of times (eBay recommends twice). If the error persists, contact Developer Technical Support. Once the problem has been resolved, the request may be resent in its original form.

Code so that your app gracefully handles any future changes to this list.
Errors.ErrorCode	token	Conditionally	A unique code that identifies the particular error condition that occurred. Your application can use error codes as identifiers in your customized error-handling algorithms.
See Errors By Number.

Errors.ErrorParameters	ErrorParameterType	Conditionally,
repeatable: [0..*]	This optional element carries a list of context-specific error variables that indicate details about the error condition. These are useful when multiple instances of ErrorType are returned.
Errors.ErrorParameters
  [ attribute ParamID ]	string	Conditionally	This optional element carries a list of context-specific error variables that indicate details about the error condition. These are useful when multiple instances of ErrorType are returned.
Errors.ErrorParameters.Value	string	Conditionally	This is the value of the request parameter noted in the ParamID attribute. So, if the ParamID value was ItemID, the value in this field would be the actual value of that ItemID.
Errors.LongMessage	string	Conditionally	A more detailed description of the condition that raised the error.
Errors.SeverityCode	SeverityCodeType	Conditionally	Indicates whether the error is a severe error (causing the request to fail) or an informational error (a warning) that should be communicated to the user.

Applicable values:

CustomCode
(out) Reserved for internal or future use.
Error
(out) The request that triggered the error was not processed successfully. When a serious application-level error occurs, the error is returned instead of the business data.

If the source of the problem is within the application (such as a missing required element), change the application before you retry the request.
If the problem is due to end-user input data, please alert the end-user to the problem and provide the means for them to correct the data. Once the problem in the application or data is resolved, you can attempt to re-send the request to eBay.
If the source of the problem is on eBay's side, An application can retry the request as-is a reasonable number of times (eBay recommends twice). If the error persists, contact Developer Technical Support. Once the problem has been resolved, the request may be resent in its original form.


See the Error handling section of the Making a Trading API call guide for more information.
Warning
(out) The request was processed successfully, but something occurred that may affect your application or the user. For example, eBay may have changed a value the user sent in. In this case, eBay returns a normal, successful response and also returns the warning.

When a warning occurs, the error is returned in addition to the business data. In this case, you do not need to retry the request (as the original request was successful). However, depending on the cause or nature of the warning, you might need to contact either the end user or eBay to effect a long term solution to the problem to prevent it from reoccurring in the future.

Code so that your app gracefully handles any future changes to this list.
Errors.ShortMessage	string	Conditionally	A brief description of the condition that raised the error.
HardExpirationWarning	string	Conditionally	Expiration date of the user's authentication token. Only returned within the 7-day period prior to a token's expiration. To ensure that user authentication tokens are secure and to help avoid a user's token being compromised, tokens have a limited life span. A token is only valid for a period of time (set by eBay). After this amount of time has passed, the token expires and must be replaced with a new token.
Timestamp	dateTime	Always	This value represents the date and time when eBay processed the request. The time zone of this value is GMT and the format is the ISO 8601 date and time format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ). See the Time Values section in the eBay Features Guide for information about this time format and converting to and from the GMT time zone.

Note: GetCategories and other Trading API calls are designed to retrieve very large sets of metadata that change once a day or less often. To improve performance, these calls return cached responses when you request all available data (with no filters). When this occurs, this time value reflects the time the cached response was created. Thus, this value is not necessarily when the request was processed. However, if you specify an input filter to reduce the amount of data returned, the calls retrieve the latest data (not cached). When this occurs, this time value does reflect when the request was processed.
Version	string	Always	The version of the response payload schema. Indicates the version of the schema that eBay used to process the request. See the Standard Data for All Calls section in the eBay Features Guide for information on using the response version when troubleshooting CustomCode values that appear in the response.

Returns all your Buying data.

Description

A potential buyer wants to retrieve all the information about items she is interested in buying, including the items she is watching, items she is bidding on, items she has made offers on (Best Offers), items she has won, and items she has lost. In addition, she wants to review her buying summary.

Input

Setting DetailLevel to ReturnAll returns all the buying containers, with the exception of the BuyingSummary. Because of this, you must make a specific request to return the BuyingSummary.
