/item_summary/search

This method searches for eBay items by various query parameters and retrieves summaries of the items. You can search by keyword, category, eBay product ID (ePID), or GTIN, charity ID, or a combination of these.

Note: Only listings where FIXED_PRICE (Buy It Now) is a buying option are returned by default. To retrieve listings that do not have FIXED_PRICE as a buying option, the buyingOptions filter can be used to retrieve those listings.

Note that an auction listing enabled with the Buy it Now feature will initially show AUCTION and FIXED_PRICE as buying options, but if/when that auction listing receives a qualifying bid, only AUCTION remains as a buying option. If this happens, the buyingOptions filter would need to be used to retrieve that auction listing.

This method also supports the following:
Filtering by the value of one or multiple fields, such as listing format, item condition, price range, location, and more. For the fields supported by this method, refer to the filter parameter.
Retrieving the refinements (metadata) of an item, such as item aspects (color, brand) condition, category, etc. using the fieldgroups parameter.
Filtering by item aspects and other refinements using the aspect_filter parameter.
Filtering for items that are compatible with a specific product, using the compatibility_filter parameter.
Creating aspects histograms, which enables shoppers to drill down in each refinement narrowing the search results.
For additional information and examples of these capabilities, refer to Browse API in the Buying Integration Guide.
Pagination and sort controls
There are pagination controls (limit and offset fields) and sort query parameters that control/sort the data that are returned. By default, results are sorted by Best Match. For more information about Best Match, refer to Best Match.
Restrictions
This method can return a maximum of 10,000 items. For a list of supported sites and other restrictions, refer to API Restrictions.

eBay Partner Network: In order to receive a commission for your sales, you must use the URL returned in the itemAffiliateWebUrl field to forward your buyer to the ebay.com site.

URI parameters
Parameter	Type	Description
q	string	A string consisting of one or more keywords used to search for items on eBay.

Note: The * wildcard character is not allowed in this field.

When providing two or more keywords in a single query, the string is processed as follows:
When successive keywords are separated by a space, the list of keywords is processed as an AND request. For example, to retrieve items that include both of the keywords iphone AND ipad, submit the following query:
/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=iphone ipad
When successive keywords are comma-separated and surrounded by a single pair of parentheses, OR if the keywords are each URL-encoded, the list of keywords is processed as an OR request. For example, to retrieve items that include iphone OR ipad, submit one of the following queries:
/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=(iphone, ipad)
/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=%28iphone%2c%20ipad%29

Note: When specifying keywords using the q parameter:
Do not include an epid or gtin parameter value as neither can be used in conjunction with a keyword search.
Strings longer than 100-characters are truncated.


Maximum length: 100 characters
Occurrence: Conditional

gtin	string	This field lets you search for a product by specifying a Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) of the product. Supported GTIN types are UPC, EAN, and ISBN.

For example:
/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?gtin=099482432621
Note: When constructing a query, gtin value may be combined with an epid value, but neither an epid or gtin value should be combined with a keywords search through the q parameter.
Occurrence: Conditional

charity_ids	array of string	The charity ID filters results to return only those items associated with the specified charity.

Note: charity_ids is only supported by the US and UK marketplaces.

Charity ID is a charity's unique identification number:
In the US, this is the Employer Identification Number (EIN).
In the UK, this is the Charity Registration Number (CRN), commonly called Charity Number.

charity_ids may be retrieved/determined as follows:
Search for a supported charity using the Charity API's getCharityOrgs method.

Important! The value to be passed in as charity_ids is that returned in the registrationId field.

Search for a supported charity by visiting Charity Search. Click on the charity's name to display its information. The EIN number is included in the charity's information block at the top of the page.

For example, the charity ID for American Red Cross, is 530196605.
Up to 20 comma-separated charity_ids may be specified in each query. Additionally, charity_ids may be combined with category_ids and/or q keyword values to further filter returned results.

A sample query using charity_ids is:
/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?charity_ids=13-1788491,300108469
Occurrence: Optional

fieldgroups	array of string	A comma-separated list of values that controls what is returned in the response. The default is MATCHING_ITEMS, which returns the items that match the keyword or category specified. The other values return data that can be used to create histograms or provide additional information.

Valid Values:
ASPECT_REFINEMENTS
This field group adds the aspectDistributions container to the response.

Note: Information returned by ASPECT_REFINEMENTS is category specific.
BUYING_OPTION_REFINEMENTS
This field group adds the buyingOptionDistributions container to the response.
CATEGORY_REFINEMENTS
This field group adds the categoryDistributions container to the response.
CONDITION_REFINEMENTS
This field group adds the conditionDistributions containers, such as NEW, USED, etc., to the response. Within these groups are multiple states of the condition.

For example, NEW can be New without tag, New in box, New without box, etc.
EXTENDED
This field group adds the following fields to the response:
shortDescription
itemLocation.city
MATCHING_ITEMS (default value)
This field group is intended to be used with one or more of the refinement values listed above. This is used to return the specified refinements and all matching items.
FULL
This field group returns all refinement containers and all matching items.
Default: MATCHING_ITEMS
Occurrence: Optional

compatibility_filter	CompatibilityFilter	This field specifies the attributes used to define a specific product. The service searches for items matching the keyword, or matching the keyword and a product attribute value in the title of the item.

Note: The only products supported are cars, trucks, and motorcycles.

For example, if the keyword is brakes and compatibility-filter=Year:2018;Make:BMW, the items returned are items with brakes, 2018, or BMW in the title.

The service uses the product attributes to determine whether the item is compatible. The service returns the attributes that are compatible and the CompatibilityMatchEnum value that indicates how well the item matches the attributes.

Tip: Refer to the Samples section for a detailed example.


Best Practice: Submit all of the product attributes for the specific product.

To find the attributes and values for a specific marketplace, use the getCompatibilityProperties method in the Taxonomy API.

For more information, refer to Check compatibility in the Buying Integration Guide.

Note: Testing in Sandbox is only supported using mock data. Refer to Testing search in the Sandbox for details.

Required:
q (keyword)
One parts-compatibility-supported category ID (such as 33559 Brakes)
At least one vehicle attribute name/value pair
Occurrence: Optional

auto_correct	array of string	A query parameter that enables auto correction.

A sample is shown below:
/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?auto_correct=KEYWORD
Note: Auto correction is currently supported in the following marketplaces:
United States
Austria
Australia
Canada
Switzerland
Germany
Spain
France
United Kingdom
Ireland
Italy

Valid Values: KEYWORD
Occurrence: Optional

category_ids	array of string	The category ID is used to limit the results that are returned. This field may pass in one category ID or a comma separated list of IDs as illustrated in the following examples:
/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?category_ids=29792
/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?category_ids=267,29792
Note: Currently, you can pass in only one category ID per request.

To refine the set of information that is returned, category_ids may be combined with EITHER:
epid and/or gtin values
q keywords
For example, when looking of a toy phone, simply searching for "phone" will return mobile phones because that is the "Best Match" for the search. To further refine the request to include toy phones, include the Toys & Hobbies category ID as illustrated here:
/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=phone&category_ids=220
Because the list of eBay category IDs is not published and category IDs are not the same across all eBay marketplaces, category IDs may be determined by:
Visiting the Category Changes page
Using the Taxonomy API. Refer to Get Categories for Buy APIs for complete information.
Issuing the following call to retrieve the dominantCategoryId for an item:
/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q= keyword&fieldgroups=ASPECT_REFINEMENTS
Note: If a top-level (L1) category is specified, you must also include a q query parameter.
Occurrence: Optional

filter	array of FilterField	An array of field filters that can be used to limit/customize the result set.

Refer to Buy API Field Filters for additional information and examples of all supported filters.

For example, to filter shirts based on a specific range of prices, include the filter illustrated here:
/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=shirt&filter=price:[10..50]
Filters may also be combined within a single request as illustrated in the sample below which further refines results to return only those shirts available from specific sellers:
/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=shirt&filter=price:[10..50],sellers:{rpseller|bigSal}
Occurrence: Optional

sort	array of SortField	Specifies the criteria on which returned items are to be sorted.

Items can be sorted in ascending order based on:
Price (sort=price)
Returned items are sorted based on their total cost (i.e., price + shipping cost).

Items with the lowest combined price are shown first.

When sorting by price, it is highly recommended that:
The X-EBAY-C-ENDUSERCTX request header is used, and
The contextualLocation parameter specifies the delivery country and postal code.

These values must be URL-encoded.
Refer to the following example:
X-EBAY-C-ENDUSERCTX: contextualLocation=country%3DUS%2Czip%3D19406
Descending price order
To sort items from highest price to lowest price insert a minus sign (-) before price as the search criterion:
sort=-price
Distance (sort=distance)
Returned items are sorted based on their distance from the buyer's location.

Items that are closest to the buyer are listed first.

Important! When sorting by distance, all required pickup filters must be included in the request.

Date
Items can be sorted by date based on:
Listing date (sort=newlyListed)
Returned items are sorted based on their itemOriginDate.

Newly listed items are shown first.
End date (sort=endingSoonest)
Returned items are sorted based on the date/time on which their listing is scheduled to end.

Items that are closest to their scheduled ending date/time are shown first.
If no sort parameter is submitted, the result set is sorted by "Best Match". Refer to Optimizing your listings for Best Match for additional information.
Occurrence: Optional

limit	string	The number of items from the result set returned in a single page.

Note: If a value is set in the limit field, the value of offset must be either zero or a multiple of the limit value. An error is returned for invalid offset values.

Note: This method can return a maximum of 10,000 items in one results set.

Min: 1

Max: 200

Default: 50
Occurrence: Optional

offset	string	Specifies the number of items to skip in the result set. This is used with the limit field to control the pagination of the output.

For example:
If offset is 0 and limit is 10, the method will retrieve items 1-10 from the list of items returned
If offset is 10 and limit is 10, the method will retrieve items 11-20 from the list of items returned.
Note: The value of offset must be either zero or a multiple of the value set in the limit field. An error is returned for invalid offset values.

Note: This method can return a maximum of 10,000 items in one results set.

Min: 0

Max: 9,999

Default: 0
Occurrence: Optional

aspect_filter	AspectFilter	This field lets you filter by item aspects. The aspect name/value pairs and category, which is required, is used to limit the results to specific aspects of the item. For example, in a clothing category one aspect pair would be Color/Red.

Note: The category ID must be specified twice:
Once as a URI parameter in the category_ids field
Once as part of the aspect_filter field
These two values must be the same.

For example, to return items for a woman's red shirt, issue the following request:
/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=shirt&category_ids=15724&aspect_filter=categoryId:15724,Color:{Red}
To get a list of the aspect pairs and the category, which is returned in the dominantCategoryId field, set fieldgroups to ASPECT_REFINEMENTS as illustrated here:
/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=shirt&fieldgroups=ASPECT_REFINEMENTS
Note: The pipe symbol is used as a delimiter between aspect filter values. If a value contains a pipe symbol (for example, the brand name 'Bed|Stü'), you must enter a backslash before the pipe character to prevent it from being evaluated as a delimiter.

The following example illustrates the correct format for entering two brand names as aspect filter values, one of which contains a pipe symbol:
/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?limit=50&category_ids=3034&filter=buyingOptions:{AUCTION|FIXED_PRICE}&aspect_filter=categoryId:3034,Brand:{Bed\|Stü|Nike}
Occurrence: Optional

epid	string	The ePID is the eBay product identifier of a product from the eBay product catalog. This field limits the results to only items in the specified ePID.

Use the product_summary/search method in the Catalog API to search for the ePID of the product.

For example:
/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?epid=15032
Note: When constructing a query, epid may be combined with a gtin value. However, do not specify keywords using the q parameter — keywords cannot be used in conjunction with an epid.
Occurrence: Conditional

HTTP request headers
All requests made to eBay REST operations require you to provide the Authorization HTTP header for authentication authorization.

The table below shows additional HTTP request headers that are either required, conditionally required, or strongly recommended for this method. Other standard HTTP request headers- opens rest request components page (not in this table) can also be used, but they are optional.

Header	Type	Description
Accept-Language	string	This header is used to indicate the natural language and locale preferred by the user for the response.

Sample 3: Refine Keyword Results by Category
Using a category ID with a keyword gives you additional control over the result set. For example, let's say you are looking of a toy phone. If you search for "phone", the result set will be mobile phones because this is the "Best Match" for this search. But if you also include the toy category ID, the results will be what you wanted.

Input
The inputs are q and categoryIds URI parameters. There is no payload with this request.

https://api.ebay.com/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=phone&category_ids=220&limit=3
